<li>Well, the woman’s problem is that she is supposed to drive a bunch of kids to the zoo tomorrow but she couldn’t rent a van. Accordingly, the man offers two solutions: she could perhaps borrow a car form one of her friends for the trip, or she could try public transportation instead. Well I think the woman should try public transportation for two reasons. Safety would be the first reason of my recommendation. The tour bus drivers are generally more experienced and professional especially when carrying a bunch of kids. All she needs to do is to focus on keeping the kids safe and cheered up, so it will be a lot easier and more manageable. Comparatively speaking, it’s undoubtedly more dangerous for the woman to plan some self-driving trip, letting alone carrying a bunch of kids. Irresponsible, I’d say, if anything bad happens. All in all, I strongly recommend the public transportation as a better option. (160 words)</li>

<li>Well, the woman’s got a problem that she is now invited by her professor to a field trip but it conflicts with the museum exhibition which she is helping setting up. There are two solutions for the woman to solve the problem. She could ask her professor to find scxne other student to the field trip or she could hurry up to finish setting up the museum exhibition ahead of time so that she could go to the trip after that. I guess the woman should take the second solution for two reasons. First of all, field trips are usually the most helpful activities of our study life, especially during our break. We students could put everything we learned into real practice, to prove and to test results and conclusions from the classes and textbooks, so any student should not miss any field trips. Secondly, she could speed up her setting up the museum exhibition by asking others for some help especially with the trivial work and the details, and therefore I am sure she could finish her work with the museum set-up before the field trip. (186 words)The professor asks the woman to attend a field trip, but the woman has already promised another professor to help set up a museum exhibition next week. And this is the problem. The professor offers two possible solutions. The first is that she can talk to the other professor to see if there is someone else who can replace the woman to help set up the museum exhibition. The second is that the woman finishes setting up the museum before they set out the field trip. Actually, I think the woman should choose the second solution, because she has already agreed to help the other professor and the other professor is counting on her. It’s possible that there is no one else who can take her place. So she’d better finish the task first before she goes to the field trip.</li>

<li>Well, the woman’s problem is that her award ceremony conflicts with her coming biology exam, and accordingly the man offers two solutions for the woman: first, she could talk to her professor about the schedule conflict or second, she could find someone else to receive the award for her. In such a dilemma, l believe the second solution is a better one for two main reasons. Fcx one thing, a five-page paper is even more time appealing and exhausting than her biology exam, because it is known to all that students could easily get an exam cracked within like no more than 5 days but it usually takes at least more than 2 weeks to get a paper done. Second, finding someone to receive the award would be really easy—maybe a phone call will do and still the woman could get her award. (148 words)The woman won an award and is invited to attend the award ceremony. But her biology exam is scheduled at the same time. So she is struggling about what to do. There are two possible solutions. The first one is that she could write a 5-page paper instead of taking the exam. But she thinks writing a paper will take more time than preparing for and taking an exam. She’s got many other things to do. The second solution is that she could ask someone else to receive the award on her behalf. But her parents were really looking forward to seeing her on the stage. Still, she’s struggling. Well, I would recommend her to choose the first solution. Since she doesn’t want to disappoint her parents, she has to try harder to win the time to attend the ceremony even though it’ll take her more time to write the paper. It’s the trade-off.</li>

<li>The man’s problem is that as a freshman he couldn’t find his way to his class because he left his class schedule in his dorm. Accordingly the woman offers two solutions for the man: first he could go to the student center to check the room number for his class on a computer. Second he could try his luck checking every room for his class in this building. Well, in such a dilemma I think the man should go straight to the student center to check his classroom because the student center is not too far from where he stays and he will definitely get precise information on the computer. If he hurries he will just be on time. Secondly, checking each room would be rude and abrupt and more importantly time-wasting, especially for such a huge building: the right room could be the last room he tries in this building and he could probably be late. So I agree that the man should go to the student center to check information up. (174 words)The man didn’t take his class schedule with him and it’s his first day in the college, so he couldn’t find his classroom. The woman offers two possible solutions. The first solution is that he can go to use the computer in the computer center to check the schedule. But it’ll take some time to go there and he doesn’t want to be late for his first class. The second solution is that he can just go to big classrooms in the building to check which one is the class he is going to take. But he thinks it’ll be embarrassing if he goes into a classroom and asks if he is in the right room. I would recommend him to go to the computer center, since he didn’t take his class schedule, it’s necessary to check all classes for the whole day. Maybe he’ll be late for his first class, but at least he won’t feel embarrassed for the rest of the day.</li>

<li>Well, the woman’s problem is that she sprained her wrist but she’s supposed to play the violin in her string quartet’s big concert next week. Accordingly she is thinking that maybe she could try playing anyway, or as the man suggested she should get someone to replace her. Well, I guess the woman should find some substitute for her quartet instead of playing by herself anyway. For one thing, sprained wrist is definitely a disaster for any violin player. If she does not take enough rest to recover her wrist completely, she’ll probably risk herself with some unpleasant consequences that she would feel sorry for some day in the future. Second, finding a substitude player will do good to her team. After all, a successful concert depends on healthy players’ team-work. So based on the reasons given above I think finding someone to replace the woman would be a better idea. (150 words)The woman sprained her wrest but she is supposed to play the violin in her string-quartet concert next week. Now she is upset. In the conversation, they talk about two possible solutions. The first one is that she can just wait and play the violin in the concert next week because her doctor says that she will be better when the concert begins. But she will be out of practice and probably perform badly. The second solution is that she can ask Jim to take her place. Jim is a very good violinist. But he is not very reliable, because he is always late for rehearsals. I recommend her to choose the second solution. Since she is definitely going to be out of practice, it’s better to ask Jim to take her place. And since she knows Jim’s problem, she can urge Jim to show up on time for all the rehearsals. It’s just only a week.</li>

<li>Well the woman’s problem is that the members of her study group have become very good friends but they are just joking around instead of studying and they don’t get much study work done. Accordingly, the man offers two solutions: first she could probably have her study group meet on another day instead of Friday; and second, her study group should have a leader. In my opinion, the woman’s ’study group should have a leader. Firstly, a leader of a study group could organize a clear and effective schedule for studying, and each time members meet, all they need to do is to follow the schedule and the leader will do the final check for the result of the group. Secondly, members could take turns to be a leader to make the study schedule of the group, which will be a better motivation for all members. (146 words)The woman’s studying group has got a problem. The members all become friends and they all joke around instead of studying. The professor proposes two possible solutions. The first solution is to change the time they meet. Currently, they meet on Friday afternoons, but students are exhausted at that time and they all want to relax and unwind at the end of a week. But the woman says everyone has already got their own schedule, if they change time, they may lose members. The second solution is to find a leader. The leader can set the agenda, email it to everyone else before the meeting and then make sure everyone is focused on the topic when they meet. The professor says the woman is suitable to be the leader. But it sounds like much work to the woman. I would recommend the woman to take the second solution. If she’s worrying about the work, she can just be a temporal leader and later let other members to do the work.</li>

<li>The woman’s problem is that her papers will be due by the end of next week but her computer won’t be fixed by then. Accordingly, the man offer two solutions: she could try using the computer lab or she could call the computer repair shop to check if they could get the computer fixed at the beginning of next week/ahead of time. Well, I guess go using the computer lab is a better idea for some reasons. To begin with, the computer lab is an exact place for students especially those who don’t even own a computer to write their papers. Therefore all she needs to do is to plan her personal study schedule and try to avoid the rush hour of the lab. I am sure if she tries hard to make good use of the study time, the atmosphere there in the lab would become a better motivation instead of obstacles for her paper writing. Secondly, calling back to the shop would be comparatively a bad idea. After all, begging others to reschedule their business plan is more difficult than refine our own study plan. So I would recommend the first solution for the reasons stated above. (201 words)The woman’s computer is broken and it won’t be back until the end of next week. But it’s now the end of semester, all her papers are due next week. The man gives her two possible solutions. The first solution is to go to computer club where there are lots of machines. But the woman thinks it’s so crowded and noisy that she can’t concentrate. The second solution is to call the repair shop to ask if they can fix the computer quickly and give it back to her at the beginning of next week. Then the woman will have enough time to finish her paper. But the repair shop is closed today and tomorrow. It’ll be a few days before the woman can talk to them. I would recommend her to choose the first solution. Since time is limited and it’s not sure whether her computer can be fixed in time, using the computer center is the only choice. Even though the computer center is crowded and noisy, it’s always possible to concentrate on work.</li>

<li>Well, the man’s problem is that he needs to take two required courses to get his degree since it’s his last semester, but those two courses just conflict in his schedule. Accordingly, there are two solutions for the man: first he could do an independent study to fulfill that requirement with the permission and help of the professor; and second, he could try the same course in another university. Well, I think the first solution is a better idea for two reasons. Firstly, independent study is an indispensable way of study in college life and has essentially no difference from class study, especially with the permission and help of the professor. The man could also use the study notes from students in class and do all the reading or researching assignment, which will promote his efficiency of studying. When he’s got any questions he could just go straight to the professor on the office hours as the professor promises. Secondly, going to another university is a bad idea mainly because that will be too time-consuming. So I agree with the first solution. (185 words)The man has to take two courses to fulfill the requirement but these two courses are scheduled at the same time. In the conversation, they talked about two possible solutions. The first solution is to do independent study in the Shakespeare course. He read texts, finish assignments on his own and have discussions with the professor. But he’s afraid that he won’t be motivated. The second solution is to take the Shakespeare course in another university. But it takes him one hour to drive back and forth the universities. I would recommend he to take the Shakespeare course in the other university. Since he won’t be motivated if he studies independently,this is a good way to motivate him. Although this will cost him some time and money, he will finish the course.</li>

<li>Well, the woman’s problem is that there’s something wrong with the water pipes in her house and it takes two weeks to fix the pipes so she has to move out to find some place for her mid-term preparation. Accordingly, there are two options for her to solve the problem: first, she could move to her friends’ place; and second, she could find a small hotel near her campus. I think, the second solution is a better idea. Firstly, going to a hotel means personal space and quiet study atmosphere so she will surely prepare herself well for her mid-term. Secondly, the hotel can cost on a weekly rate which is quite reasonable for the woman, so I think she can afford it for the sake of better concentration on study after class. After all the main duty of the students is to study. So based on the reasons stated above I agree and recommend the second solution. (153 words)The woman has to move out of her apartment right away because there is something wrong with the water pipe and it’s going to take about two weeks to fix it. Also, the mid-term exams are coming up. The first solution is to stay at some friends’ place. The woman can sleep on the living room couch. But their place has already got four people, it’ll be a little crowded. Plus, there will be many distractions. The second solution is live in a hotel near campus. She could get a room there. But her budget is very tight now, even if the weekly rate is reasonable, it’ll still end up costing her some money. Considering the options and problems, I would recommend her to choose the first solution. Since her budget is tight, living at the friends’ place can save her money. Concerning the problem of distractions, she can just study in classrooms and only sleep on the couch at night.</li>

<li>Well, the woman’s problem is that she has a history paper due tomorrow and her laptop’s battery is running out but there’s no electricity in her room to charge because of the storm. Accordingly, there are two solutions from the man: the first one is that she could go to a library in another city where she could get her lap top plugged in to continue her paper; second, she could ask her professor for an extension. Well, I guess the first solution is a better idea for some reasons. First of all, the library is not far away from the woman, and if she hurries, she could get the paper done and go home before the library close just in time. A library is a perfect place for study, and all she needs is to pack her computer and go driving, which surly beats staying home praying for the extension. Secondly, asking for an extension would be a bad idea. I think, after all there must be students going to the library or finding possible ways to get the paper done just on time, letting alone those who don’t have electricity at home. So I think the woman should go to the library to finish her paper. (206 words)The woman has a history paper due tomorrow and she has been writing it on her laptop, but the electricity went out and the battery is running low. What’s worse, the electricity won’t be back before several hours. The man suggests her to go to Jefferson City. It’s got electricity and there is library where she can plug in her laptop and it’s only about 20 minutes drive. But then she has to pack up all her stuff and it’s raining outside. Then the man gives another suggestion that she can just go to ask the professor for an extension. But the woman says the professor said he didn’t grant any extensions when he assigned the paper. Well, I would recommend the girl to drive to Jefferson City. Though she has to pack her stuff and it’s raining outside, finding a place to finish her paper is the most important thing to do. As a student, she has the responsibility to finish the homework. Accident caused by weather is not an excuse for not finishing homework on time.</li>

<li>Well, the man’s problem is that it’s too late for him to apply for a dorm room for the summer so he might have no place to live in. There are two solutions for the man: first, he could stay with his parents; and second, he could rent an apartment off campus. According to my understanding, renting an apartment is a better idea for the man for two reasons. First of all, renting an apartment is what most students do when they could not find a chance to live in a dorm, and for the man, it could save him gas fee for reference books or better food. Secondly, renting an apartment always means one could choose roommate for his or her own preference, especially finding someone who shares almost the same living habits And I am sure the man would like to live with someone he really gets along well with. So I think finding an apartment is a better option. (160 words)The man has got a summer research position on campus but he didn’t apply for a dorm room for the summer. And it’s too late to apply now. In the conversation, they talk about two possible solutions. The first one is that the man can stay with his parents and commute to campus every day. His parents will be happy to have him home and many old friends will come back home for the summer vacation. But it’s a little tiring to drive on the road. The second solution is to rent an apartment near campus. It saves time and gas fee. But still the man has to pay for the rent. Well, I would recommend the man to choose the first solution. Since his parents are happy to live with him and he can meet many old friends, why not stay with his parents. Even if it’s tiring to drive, he can save the money for the rent.</li>

<li>Well, the woman’s problem is that she hopes to attend an award ceremony but she has got her philosophy exam exactly before the ceremony. Accordingly, there are two solutions for the woman’s problem: first she could try to finish her exam just before the ceremony and hurry to the ceremony just in time; the second solution is that she could talk to the professor to take the test some other time. In such a dilemma I guess she should talk to the professor to get the exam rescheduled and there are two reasons. Firstly, she could try harder studying for her exam exactly from now on, so even if the exam might be rescheduled ahead of time her preparation is even earlier. By studying harder she could get full preparation for both the exam and her attendance of the ceremony that day. Secondly, hurrying to the ceremony would be suffering for both her exam and attendance of ceremony; she could probably get both ruined. So I guess talking to the professor to get the exam time changed is a wiser choice. (186 words)The woman won an award and is invited to attend the award ceremony. But she’s got a philosophy exam that is scheduled to end at the time when the ceremony begins. There are two possible solutions. The first one is to attend the ceremony after taking the philosophy exam since these ceremonies never start on time and give long introductions. So she won’t miss anything important. But she thinks it’s a bit risky and she doesn’t want to miss being there when they announce her name. The second solution is talk to the professor and reschedule the exam. But the professor always reschedule the exam earlier which means less studying time for the woman. I think the woman had better choose the first solution. Since rescheduling exam will reduce her studying time, the second solution will probably harm her score. Even if it’s possible that she’ll miss the announcement of her name, she can still go to the award after the exam.</li>

<li>Actually, the man’s problem is that her mom’s van is down, so he couldn’t take his club members to see the exhibit tomorrow. The woman offers two suggestions for the man: he could rent a van for that trip or he could postpone the trip till his mom’s car gets fixed up. Well, I think the man could rent a van. First, nobody would blame him, for not using his mom’s car, which indeed is a quite understandable emergency, since no one would share a trip on a van that needs repairing. Secondly, I am sure his friends, the club members would be glad to share the rent and the gas fee when they get together. After all, their purpose is to enjoy the special exhibit not to take advantage of the man’s free ride. So I think the man should rent a car. (144 words)The man is supposed to drive everyone in the club to see an exhibition and he borrowed his mom’s van. But the problem is that the van broke down and can’t be repaired in time. There are two possible solutions to this problem. First, he can rent a van. But he thinks it’s a little risky. Because only a few people in the club agree to contribute some money to the van, it’s possible that the man will have to pay most of the bill. The second solution is to postpone the trip until his mom’s van is in good condition. But the man says everyone will be disappointed if they find out that they can’t go to the exhibition when they are ready. Personally, I would recommend the man to rent a van. Since some of the students have already promised to split the rent, those who haven’t replied will definitely agree to contribute money to the van. Even if the man has to pay most of the bill, he has to pay because he is the president and he has the responsibility to complete his task.</li>

<li>The man’s having a trouble with his living arrangements because his roommate is moving off campus. Accordingly, there are two solutions for his problem: firstly, he could wait for the university to assign someone to take his roommate’s place. And second, he could move out and share a house off campus with his roommate. I think the man should move to his roommate for two reasons. Firstly, it’ll be more economical to rent a house with his roommates and some other friends. I guess it’ll be even cheaper than staying in the dormitory. Besides, they could buy a second-hand car to ride together to the campus and share the gas fee, which will balance their life expense too. Last but not least, the man gets along with his roommate, and they could help each other with studying without wasting time on getting used to each other’s living habits or trivial things like that. So I strongly recommend the second solution. (160 words)The man is worrying about his housing next semester, because his great roommate is moving off campus. In the conversation, they talk about two possible solutions. The first one is waiting the university to assign a new roommate to him. But the man thinks the new roommate may have a different study habit. Like, the man is used to studying late at night. What if the new roommate likes to go to bed early? Then this will throw off the man’s study schedule. The second solution is to live in a house off campus with other students. But the thing is the house is very far away from the campus. The man has to get up much earlier to get to campus on time. In my opinion, the man had better choose the first solution, to let university assign a new roommate for him. Chances are that the new roommate also likes to study late at night. The man shouldn’t assume that the new roommate will have a completely different habit. Besides, living on campus is a lot more convenient than living off campus.</li>

<li>Well the woman’s problem is that she is supposed to wear the white shirt to stay the same with her choir members, however she could not wear her only white shirt because of a huge stain on it, and there is no time for her to buy a new one. Accordingly there are two solutions: first, the woman tries to replace her shirt by a similar colored one, and second, the man suggests she borrow one from her roommate. Well, I guess her roommate for help would be a better option, simply because what a choir needs for concert is not only perfect performance of their instruments but also perfect costumes, and obviously a similar colored shirt will ruin all that visual perfection. Second, since white shirts are common and simple outfits for students, and her roommate wouldn’t mind, the woman really has nothing to concern about. After all she is in an emergency, which is quite understandable as well. In a nut shell, I believe the woman should ask her roommate for help. (166 words)The woman is in a choir and the choir is going to have a concert in a hour. All the choir members are required to wear white shirts and black pants. But the woman spilled the spaghetti all over her white shirt and she doesn’t have time to buy another new one. There are two possible solutions. The first one is to wear another shirt that’s not exactly white. It’s a little cream color. But she won’t be looking exactly same as others and some audience may be able to tell the difference. The second solution is to borrow a shirt from her roommate. But her roommate is out of town. And the woman hates to take things without asking. Personally, I would recommend the woman to borrow the white shirt from her roommate. The woman can send a text message or voice message to her roommate to inform her. Since the concert is going to start in an hour, I think the woman’s roommate will understand her action in this emergence.</li>

<li>Well, the man’s problem is that he needs to read a book for the class discussion but he could get a copy. Accordingly thereYe two solutions for the man: he could place a rush order online or he could share the woman’s copy. I think the man should share the woman’s copy simply because the double-priced rush order is way too expensive. Besides, to share reading always means sharing thoughts and sometimes inspirations come out. By careful schedule and regular meetings, the man and the woman could have enough time to discuss and share ideas and insights together, which will be perfect preparation for their discussion in class. In a nut shell, I prefer the second solution for the man. (122 words)None of the bookstores in the campus area has the book the man wants and it’ll take about two weeks to have the book in stock. But the class will be discussing the book next Tuesday. The first solution is to buy the book on the Internet and use rush order delivery. But it’ll cost twice as much money as it takes to buy one in a bookstore. The second solution is to share the woman’s copy until he can get a book from a bookstore. He can read part of the book one day and then the woman can read part of the book another day. But the man worries that he won’t get the book back to her in time. I prefer the second solution. Just like the woman says, as long as the two students keep careful, they won’t delay each other. Furthermore, they only have to share the book for two weeks, since bookstores will have the book in two weeks.</li>

<li>The man’s problem is that he just got the first copy of his research paper back from his professor but he’s got only one day before the deadline of his final draft, so obviously he is running out of time. The woman offers to the man two solutions: he could ask his professor for an deadline extension or he could try his best to make good use of the time left. Well, I suggest that the man should go talking to the professor and ask for a deadline extension, and I have two main reasons. Firstly, it is unfair for the man to have less time preparing for his final draft than any other students, because everyone needs appropriate time to combine suggestions and to review structures and main points, and only in this way their papers can be scored equally. Secondly, no one is at fault and the man doesn’t have to worry that he may be too pushy at all, since the professor might have forgotten the dead line too. So I think asking the professor for the man’s legitimate deadline extension could be a better idea. (189 words)The man just got his first draft of paper from the professor and he has to review all the comments and write a final draft. But there is only one day left. The woman offers him two possible suggestions. The first suggestion is to ask the professor for a deadline extension. Since all the other students got their paper a few days ago and only the man got his paper just now, the professor should take some responsibility for this situation. But the man doesn’t want to seem pushy and offensive. The second possible solution is to do his best with the time left. He can finish the paper quickly and work hard. Since he is a pretty good student, he can get a pretty good grade. But there are too many comments to deal with. If I were the man, I would choose the first solution. Since this is the professor’s fault, even if it’ll be a little uncomfortable asking the extension, it’s still reasonable to do so. There is no need to worry about being offensive. The man just need to tell the problem to the professor in the first place. I’m sure the professor will understand.</li>

<li>Well, the man’s problem is that he finished his paper but forgot to take it with him today. Accordingly, he believes that he could drive home because he lives off campus. The woman suggests that the man talk to the professor and ask for a later copy of his paper by email. Well I guess talking to the professor would be a better solution for the man’s problem for two main reasons. Firstly, the man did get the paper done, and asking for extension wouldn’t be unfair for other students. Considering his attitude it’s quite understandable to be a few hours late. Second, fetching his paper at the cost of being late for most of the class is definitely not worthy. After all, it’s the class that matters to the students not the due date of paper itself. So, I guess talking to the professor about the problem would be a better solution for the man. (157 words)The man wrote his paper last night but he forgot to take it with him. There are two possible solutions. The first one is to drive back to his place and bring the paper back. Since he lives off-campus, if he hurries, he can only come back before the class is over. Still he’ll miss part of the class. The second solution is to talk to the professor and ask her if it’s okay to send the paper later by email. But the professor always starts class on time, the man will only have chance to ask her when the class is over. I would recommend the man to take the first solution. Since the professor is strict with late-submissions and he doesn’t know whether she’ll allow him to submit the paper later by email, it’s better to drive home and bring the paper back even if he’ll miss part of the class.</li>

<li>Scientists have learned that 5 month-old babies can add. Since the evidence is indirect, they devise an experiment to prove this. In the experiment, the researchers first show the baby a doll on the table, and lower a screen to hide the doll, but the baby still knows it is there. Then, they obviously add another doll behind the screen. However, after that they secretly take away one of the dolls. So when they raise the screen back up, there is only one doll there. When the researchers observed the baby’s eye movement that they had recorded during the experiment, they found that the baby stared when it saw only one doll, since babies usually stare at what surprises them. We can conclude the baby is surprised because the baby knew that one plus one equals two, and had expected two dolls when it saw only one. (143 words)In the lecture the professor describes how scientists learn about baby’s mathematical abilities. Researchers did an experiment to test baby’s ability to add–baby knows one plus one equals two. They first put a doll in front of a baby and lowered the screen to hide the doll. So the baby knows it’s there. Then they clearly put another doll behind the screen so there should be two dolls. But researchers secretly took one away and when they lift the screen up, the baby was surprised because it expected to see two dolls but there was only one. We know when a baby is surprised, it stares at the thing that makes it feel surprised. The researchers recorded the baby’s eye-movement with a camera and found that the baby stared. So the baby has the ability to add. It knows one doll plus one doll equals two dolls. </li>

<li>In broad sense, money is whatever one can use to make purchase with, so money comes in different forms. For example, you may pay a five-dollar bill to a taxi driver in exchange for a ride. And the taxi driver then may use the bill to pay a farmer for some vegetables. Anyway, some societies do not use coins and bills as their money, they use something called barter system, under which goods and services are exchanged directly for other goods or services. So the farmer may give the taxi driver some vegetables in exchange for a ride, and in this case the vegetable is a form of money under the system. A narrower definition of money is whatever a government is allowed as legal tender. For example, in the U. S. , people must use coins and bills to pay for their goods and services, like the taxi driver must accept a five-dollar bill as payment rather than some vegetables. (161 words)The professor talks about two definitions of money, a broad one and a narrow one. By the broad definition, money is everything with which we can make purchases. For example, coins and bills can be money, because we can use them to buy goods such as vegetables and pay for services such as taxi. But in a barter system, vegetables can be money, because farmers can give drivers vegetables in exchange for a drive. By the narrow definition, in a society, the legal tender is money. For instance, in the US, drivers and farmers must accept dollars as payment. People can use dollars to pay for taxi and buy vegetables because dollar is the legal tender in the US. So, dollar in the form of coin and bill is money.</li>

<li>There’re two strategies for advertisers to persuade the customers to buy their products. One strategy is repetition. Research shows that when someone is constantly exposed to certain message, he/she will probably believe in it even though it’s actually meaningless or untrue. For example, there’s a car commercial that tries to emphasize the car’s large space. In the commercial, a guy is driving around and keeps picking up different people, and every time he picks up someone, the narrator goes like “plenty of room for friends, plenty of room for families, plenty of room for everybody”. With the repeated message, people who have watched the commercial now believe that the car is roomy even though it’s not. Another strategy is to get a celebrity to advertise a product because people are more likely to accept a claim by someone they admire, like a celebrity. So if a car commercial hires a famous racecar driver as its spokesman, the viewers will be convinced that the car is very fast even though it’s not fast at all. (180 words)The professor talks about two kinds of persuasive strategies in advertising. The first strategy is repetition. When a slogan is repeated enough times, we tend to believe what the slogan says. The example is a car commercial. A guy is driving around and keeps stopping to pick up different people, each time a narrative says “Plenty of room for friends”, “Plenty of room for family” and so on. If we hear the slogan so many times, we tend to believe the car is spacious even if it’s not. The second strategy is using celebrities. We believe celebrities are trustworthy. For example, in a car commercial, if a famous race-car driver is shown in a car and says “I like my car fast”, people will believe the car is fast even if it’s actually not a very fast car.</li>

<li>The artists usually combine or manipulate some visual elements like colors and texture to convey a message or create a mood for an art work. According to the professor, one of this is the use of color. Colors appeal in different ways to the senses and thus can convey/communicate meanings, so artists use different colors to evoke different emotions. For example, red is a strong color, and artists thus use it to evoke strong emotions like anger and excitement, while blue, a cool color, has a calming effect on people. The other is the texture of a painting, an visual illusion created by the artists like roughness or softness. This can also evoke different emotions. Roughness stimulates stronger emotion, while smoothness the other way round. When artists combine these two elements together, they can create a painting that expresses wilder and more chaotic emotions by using red, orange as well as wide sweeping brushstrokes, or they can create a cooler painting with pale colors like blue and soft brush strokes. (170 words)In the lecture, the professor says in order for art to express meaning or emotion, artists need to combine various visual elements such as color and texture. Different colors can evoke different moods. Red is a strong color so it evokes strong emotions such as extreme joy, excitement and anger, whereas blue is a cool color so it evokes calming effect. As for texture, a rough texture can evoke strong emotions and strength, while a smooth texture is more calming and less emotional. Artists need to combine these elements to express meaning or convey message. For example, if a painting uses strong colors such as red and orange and uses brush strokes to give a rough texture, it will convey a wilder and more chaotic emotion in a viewer than a painting with soft colors and smooth texture. </li>

<li>There are two types of motivation that can lead us to behave in certain ways. The first one is extrinsic motivation. That is external reward like money or praise. For example, a child who regularly does housework keeps doing this only because she gets paid by her parents, so the payment is an extrinsic motivation. Once the reward is gone, the child will stop doing it. The second one is intrinsic motivation, that is, people do something because they get a sense of accomplishment or just pleasure, from the activity itself rather than some external rewards. And it lasts longer than extrinsic motivation. For example, the professor keeps going to the gym for 5 years. And she does this not because she actually earns anything from this, like training for marathon, but she feels good about herself  when she does this. So this is an intrinsic motivation and it helps her persist with her work-out for 5_years. (160 words)In the lecture, the professor talks about two types of motivation: extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation. Extrinsic motivation is external. A person with extrinsic motivation performs a behavior in order to get an external reward. For example, a child who does some housework doesn’t really enjoy doing housework. She just wants to obtain some money. If her parents stop giving her money, she might stop doing the housework. However, people with intrinsic motivation do something out of pure pleasure. They do something because they enjoy doing it or they get a sense of accomplishment from it. For example, the professor goes to the gym several times week. She is not going there for Marathon training or anything. She goes there because after some exercise she feels good about herself.</li>

<li>Active attention is voluntary, it occurs when students force themselves to pay attention, so it won’t last for a very long time. For example, you’re teaching in a biology class, and you are describing the frog to students. If you only describe it by lecturing, students will get distracted easily because they are paying active attention that is hard to keep. However, passive attention is involuntary, it happens naturally without any effort, and it lasts longer. If something interesting happens, students begin to pay passive attention even without being aware of it. For example, in the same class, if you describe the frog by showing the students a live frog instead, they will be interested and therefore pay their passive attention. As long as the frog is still there the students will focus on the class. (137 words)Active attention is that we intentionally pay attention to something, so it’s voluntary. Since it requires efforts, it won’t last very long. Passive attention is involuntary and lasts longer than active attention. In the lecture, the professor uses a biology class as an example. Suppose I am the teacher of the class and the topic is about frog. If I walk into the classroom and stand on the podium saying “Frog is kind of animal…” , the students will force themselves to pay attention to my words but this active attention won’t last long. The students will be distracted sooner or later. However, if I take a live frog with me and show it to the students while talking about it, the students will be interested and will involuntarily pay attention to my class. So by taking something unexpected, I make the class engaging and tap into(utilize, take advantage of) the students’ passive attention.</li>

<li>There’re two factors of high quality. The first one is reliability, which refers to the quality that a product works the way consumers expect and doesn’t go wrong very soon. For example, if a car works properly without needing repairs too soon, it’s reliable. People used to care about reliability most, but now as the manufacturing standard becomes higher, the products are all very reliable, so people begin to pay more attention to features. Features are the extras that are not necessary to a product but can make the product cooler and better to use. For example, nowadays cars are loaded with features like electric windows, sunroofs and stereos because these features make cars cooler, also easier to use. (126 words)When a purchaser is considering two identically priced products, they make decisions according to the quality. There are two major factors of product quality: reliability and features. A product is reliable when it works the way we expect. For example, if a car doesn’t work the way it should and it needs repair all the time, it is not reliable. So reliability means the absence of defects and problems. However, our concern with reliability is different now, manufacture standards are so high that products are all very reliable. So reliability is not a deciding factor anymore. Instead, features are becoming more important in making decisions. Features are extras and things aren’t necessary. Features make a product cool and easier to use. For example, in a car, features are electric windows, air conditioning and stereos. Since reliability of different products are almost equal, people care more about the features.</li>

<li>There’re two types of strategies companies use to set initial price for their product. The first one is to set the initial price high in order to create a high-end image for its product and lower it later. Because the products of high price are often assumed to be of high quality, the company can profit from the people who are willing to pay the high price despite the awareness that it’ll come down later. Another strategy is to set the initial price low to undercut competitors, and this strategy is usually adopted in the market that is saturated with the products. For example, a computer company may sell its computers at an affordable price to attract customers who don’t have plans for a computer or to persuade those with one to switch brand. Even with the low price, the company still manages to make profit by encouraging its customers to buy the accessories from the same company. (161 words)The professor talks about two approaches to make initial price of products. One approach is to set the initial price high followed by a lower price later, because companies want to build a high quality image for new products and products with high price are believed to have high quality. Companies can make profits from customers who are willing to pay high price to experience high quality products, especially those innovative high-tech products such as video recorders, video cameras and even cell-phones. Another approach is to set the initial price low to undercut competitors. For example, if a new computer company wants to gain market share, it sells computer in an affordable price. So the company can appeal to customers who wouldn’t be interested to buy computers and those who want to change brand. The company can make profits through selling accessories to its customers.</li>

<li>According to the professor?there’re two ways for plants to protect themselves from insects. The first one is physical defense; some plants like passion plant have physical features that prevent insects from landing on them. The passion plant has little spiky hairs that cover the whole leave. Since the spiky hairs are numerous and dense, the insects can hardly find room to stand on leaves, and therefore cannot eat leaves. Another one is chemical defense, like the one potato plant uses. When attacked by insects, the plant releases a chemical over its leaf system, which discourages the insect from further eating the plant by making the insect feel full, so the insect may think it’s already had enough and stops eating. In this way the potato plant protects itself from insects. (127 words)The professor talks about two different ways plants develop to protect themselves from insects.

For instance, potato plant releases a kind of chemical whenever insects start eating its leaves.

<li>Babies were assumed to react only to themselves, but there’re experiments that show that babies actually have emotion of higher level, that is empathy, which means they can relate and react to the feelings of the others. In the first part of the experiment, the researcher played to the baby some other babies’ cry, and the baby cried when it heard the recording. So at this stage, the researchers assumed that baby cried because of the noise, which was distressing itself. However, they realized later that they were wrong when they did the second part of the experiment, in which they played the tape of the baby’s own cry and surprisingly found that the baby didn’t cry. The second part of the experiment suggests that the baby was probably not upset by the noise of cry as it didn’t cry for his own cry, but that it felt the empathy for the babies whose cry was recorded in the tape. (168 words)The professor talks about an experiment testing babies’ empathy. We all know that if one baby cries in a room, other babies in the same room will cry. Originally, we think it’s because of the noise of the crying, which means baby is directly influenced by the noise rather than feel concern for other babies. But in the experiment, the researchers played a tape recording of a baby’s cry to another baby, then of course the other baby cries. Then the researchers played a tape recording of the baby’s own crying which is equally noisy; however the baby didn’t cry. So baby cried not because of the noise. It could be that the baby felt empathy for the other baby. Then researchers concluded that it’s possible that babies feel empathy, concern, for others.</li>

<li>There’re two principles for balance in interior design, one is unity, another is contrast. Unity means bringing together same elements into a design. For example, you can use green to decorate your house, grassy green for the wall, darker shady green for the sofa and complement with a matching green in the rug. And this will provide you a sense of order and consistence. However, if you have too much unity in a room, it’ll become boring. So you need some contrast to break up that unity, to make your rocxn livelier. For example, you can put bright red cushions on the green sofa, so that the green appears greener next to the red. But you should be careful because too much contrast probably will also destroy the balance by making the room seem busy. (140 words)In the lecture, the professor says an effective design needs to balance unity and contrast.  An easy way to achieve unity is to bring together similar elements. A common practice is by matching colors. For example, we can pick green and use light shade green for the walls, dark shade green for the sofa, and green for the rug. When elements match, the room is unified and gives senses of order and comfort. But too much unity will make a room boring. So we need contrast to break the unity. Contrast serves to disrupt unity in a careful and intentional way. In order to create color contrast, we need to change colors now and then. For example, we could put light red cushion on the dark green sofa. Contrast makes things stand out. Green will look greener next to the red. But too much contrast will make a room feel dizzy and chaotic. So an effective design must avoid too much unity and too much contrast.</li>

<li>Sometimes the demand of a product can be influenced by the price of related product, and there’re two types of those interrelated products. The first is called substitute goods, which means the two products can replace each other. So when the price of one goes up, the demand for the other goes up?too. Take butter and margarine. If the price of butter increases, and is therefore increasingly unaffordable for people, people will begin to buy more margarine, which means the demand for margarine goes up. Another is complement products. That is, either one of the two products can not be used until with the other. For example, compact disc and disc player are complement product, and you cannot use compact disc without a player. The demand for both will decrease if either of them becomes more expensive. For instance, if the price of CD increases, the demand of CD player will go down. (152 words)The demand of a product can be influenced by the price of a related product. The first kind related products are called substitute goods, goods that can be substituted for one and another. They are interchangeable so the increase in the price of one product means the increase in the demand for another. For example, butter and margarine are interchangeable. If the price of butter goes up, people will buy margarine instead. So the increase in the price of butter lead to the increase in demand for margarine. The second kind related products are called complement goods, goods that can’t be used without each other. They complement or complete each other. For example, compact discs and disc player are complement products since they should always be used together. So if the price of either product increases, the demand for both will decrease. If the price of CD goes up, the demand for CD will go down. Since CD player complements CD, the demand for CD player will go down too.</li>

<li>Some sea animals, in order to survive from predators, develop some kinds of camouflage to blend in with their environment. One of them is a kind of fish called leafy sea dragon. It looks like a green dragon with small leaf-like protrusions sticking out from its body like arms. Its color and shape help it to perfectly match with its environment. When it’s swimming among the green sea plants; it looks just like the sea plants, so its predators are not able to detect it. But the camouflage will lose its efficacy if the fish enters a different surrounding without the plants. So there’s another kind of camouflage that is able to change as circumstances change. For example, the cuttlefish has shifting pigment that allows immediate color change if need be, so it can always go with its surroundings to avoid being recognized and eaten by predators wherever it is. (151 words)Some sea animals have developed colors and shapes to resemble environmental features in order to avoid predators. For example, leafy sea dragon has leafy protrusions sticking out like arms. Its shape and color resemble the green sea plants so it blends in well in the environment. When it is swimming through green sea plants, predators have trouble seeing it. But without green plants, its camouflage doesn’t work. Another example is cuttlefish. Unlike leafy sea dragon, Cuttlefish’s camouflage can work anywhere. It changes color to blend in any environment. It has shifting pigments and can change color instantly. If it is swimming by the green sea plants, its color can change to green. If it is swimming by the brown sea floor, its color changes to brown.</li>

<li>Because the deeper part of the ocean is cold and dark, food source there is scarce, so deep sea organisms develop some adaptations to survive. For example, many organisms have physical features that help them to eat preys that are bigger even than them selves, like a kind of eel. The eel has a huge mouth and a large stomach that can expand, so it can eat a large prey that turns into plenty of energy and nutrition to help it sustain for quite a while, before it needs to eat again. Another is the ability to generate light that can be used to capture prey. For example, angler fish has a light-generating structure on its head that is close to its mouth. And when it glows in the dark, other organisms may assume it’s something to eat and are therefore attracted by it. But when they get close enough, the angler fish will catch and eat them. (161 words)The professor uses two examples to illustrate two adaptations that help animals survive in the deepest parts of the ocean. The first example is a kind of eel fish. This eel fish has body features that allow it to eat prey larger than itself. It has an enormous mouth and a stomach that can expand. So when it captures a big prey, it gains a lot food, a lot of nutrition. This allows eel fish to sustain very long before it find another prey. The second example is angler fish. Angler fish has the ability to generate light. It has a little structure on its head which produces light and glows in the dark. The light is close to the fish’s mouth and many other fishes are attracted to this light. So they swim straight toward it and make it easier for angler fish to capture food.</li>

<li>Some birds have eyes that face forwards on the skull, like human eyes. And this kind of eyes allow a bird to clearly see and judge distances with its ability to focus on objects with both eyes and accurately perceive height, width and depth. For example, the hawk has forward eyes on its skull that can allow it to accurately spot its prey, mouse, in the field, even from up in the air. And once it locates the mouse, it swoops down to catch it. Other birds have eyes that are positioned on each side of their skull to help protect themselves from predators. Having eyes on both sides of the skull makes it possible for these birds to watch danger from all directions. For example, a duck eating grasses and insects near the edge of a lake is on constant lookout on both sides for danger from the fox. Once detecting a fox, it can escape. The professor talks about how the position of bird’s eyes help them find food and avoid predators. Some birds have eyes that face forward to the skull so that they can clearly see and judge distance. They can focus on things with both eyes and accurately predict height, width and depth. For example, hawks position their eyes in the front. They have such a good eye sight that they can spot a tiny mouse in a field from high in the sky. When they spot a mouse, they will swoop down and catch it. So the placement of their eyes help them find food. Some other birds have their eyes positioned on each side of the skull in order to avoid predators. Their eyes on both sides help them watch for dangers. For example, when a duck is eating grass and insects, it is constantly looking out for danger from both sides. If a fox is approaching from either side, the duck will fly and escape. So the placement of ducks’ eyes help them avoid predators. </li>

<li>Internal locus of control means the belief that the control comes from oneself rather than external force, and thus the person who has it will attribute their success to their personal effort. For example, if a woman with internal locus of control goes to a job interview, she’ll work very hard to prepare for the interview ahead of time. If she gets the job, she’ll attribute it all to her own effort. But if she doesn’t, she may be upset about herself and try to figure out why she fails and how to improve the next time. However, external locus of control is different. The person with it believes in the decisive role of external forces. For example, a man with external locus of control will attribute his success of a job interview to the interviewer’s good mood and luck rather than his own effort, or blame his failure for bad luck or the interviewers instead of his own problem. And he won’t even try to improve himself for the next time. (183 words)The professor uses two interviewees as examples to explain internal and external locus of control. In the first example, the girl who has internal locus of control believes her success and preparation are her responsibilities. So she worked hard ahead of time. If she succeed, she will think its because of her hard work. If she fails, she will be disappointed and try to figure out how she can improve for the next time. Another example is a man who has external locus of control. He thinks interviewers have more influence on his interview, which means his success depends on luck. So he didn’t work hard to prepare for the interview. He is more likely to take risks, interviewing jobs that he is not qualified for. If he gets it, he thinks it’s because interviewers are having a good day. If he doesn’t get it, he will blame the interviewers and won’t try to figure out how he might have done better. </li>

<li>Diffusion is a cultural process through which a cultural feature, like a custom_or an innovation is spread from one group or society to another when the two cultures come into contact. This process can take place over long distances and over long periods of time. A good example of this is reading modern newspaper in the U. S. The characters in the paper were borrowed from another culture hundreds of years ago; the printing was invented in Germany; then the paper itself was invented in China. However, the process of diffusion does not happen easily; it’s selective. For example, the practice of Chinese acupuncture has been accepted by many people in the U. S. as an effective way of relieving pain and curing disease. But the philosophy behind it was hardly understood and accepted because the idea was too foreign, and people tend to resist the ideas that are too different from their own values and beliefs. (155 words)Diffusion is a culture process whereby one group or society adopts another’s item such as a custom, a type of food or an invention. Take the modern newspaper in the US as an example, the characters on the page came from another culture many centuries ago, the printing of words was invented in Germany and paper in China. These innovations were shared across cultures over a long distance and over a long periods of time. Besides, diffusion is sometimes selective. For example, people in the US accept the practice of acupuncture, but few of them fully understand it. Because cultures tend to resist ideas that are too different from their own beliefs and values. If ideas are close to their own, they will incorporate, absorb and diffuse them. So American culture only accepts the practice of acupuncture but not the philosophy of Chinese medicine.</li>

<li>There’re two major characteristics of target customers that influence marketing strategy for products. The first one is age. For example, a toy car company tends to put their advertisements during children’s TV show so that they’re more likely to be viewed by children and their parents, which are the target customers for the company. If the children see the commercial, they’ll probably ask their parents to buy the toy for them. Another is geographical location, that’s where the target customers live. A boat company will not release ads in cities and towns that are far away from waters, but rather in places near seas or lakes, because people in those places have the need for a boat and the company will be able to maximize its sales. (133 words)The professor talks about two characteristics of target customers that can influence company’s marketing strategy. The first characteristic is age. If a company makes toy cars, its target customers are kids. It should advertise on Television during the time kids watch television. This makes sure that the advertisement reaches the kids so the company can get people in that age group to buy toy cars. The second characteristic is geographical location where the target customers live. If a company wants to sell boats, its target customers must live near ocean and lakes since only people live near water need boats. So the company will advertise in cities and towns that are near ocean and lakes in order to reach its target customers and therefore to sell more boats.</li>
