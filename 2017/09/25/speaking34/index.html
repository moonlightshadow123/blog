<p><center><strong>Letter in the Centerville College News</strong></center><br>The administration has plans to acquire a new sculpture for campus. We should all oppose this plan. The university’s poor financial condition led it to increase the price for campus housing and tuition by 15% this past year. Surely then it is no financial position to purchase such an expensive sculpture. Moreover, just look at the sculpture: several 60-foot ling steel plates, jutting out of the earth at odd angles! It’s so large, it’ll take up all the green space in front of the campus center! This is public space that should be reserved for students to use.</p>

<li>Well, the woman disagrees with the reasons and points made in the letter for some reasons. First of all, the woman believes that the money wouldn’t be a problem and the assumption in the letter is totally wrong, since an anonymous donor is paying the bill for most of the sculptures instead of the university. And she disagrees with the advice made in the letter because she thinks that the lawn taken for the sculptures will only upset Paul alone instead of other students, simply because Paul has to move to other places of the campus for his ball-playing. In a word, the woman disagrees with the letter for the reasons stated above. (116 words)The writer of the letter opposes the university’s plan to acquire a new sculpture because the university’s financial condition is poor and the sculpture is so large that it’ll take up all the green space in front of the campus center. The woman in the conversation thinks the two reasons are totally unconvincing. The woman says it’s an anonymous donor who pays the bill of the sculpture not the university so there is no need to worry about the university’s financial condition. As for the point about the space, the woman thinks Paul, the writer of the letter, always plays soccer with his friends on the lawn where the sculpture will be. She thinks Paul just doesn’t want to move to another place. For him, it’s convenience versus sculpture.</li>

<p><center><strong>Bus Service Elimination Planned</strong></center><br>The university has decided to discontinue its free bus service for students. The reason given for this decision is that few students ride the buses and the buses are expensive to operate. Currently, the buses run from the center of campus past university buildings and through some of the neighborhoods surrounding the campus. The money saved by eliminating the bus service will be used to expand the overcrowded student parking lots.</p>

<li>Well, the man disagrees with the plan for two main reasons. First of all, he believes that the route is out-of-date since it only goes through the neighborhoods that are too expensive for students to live in. If they change the bus route making it go through areas where most off-campus students live now?they will have plenty of students riding those buses. On top of that, the man thinks that the plan will encourage students to drive on campus, which will cause not only more traffic and noise but also deficient parking spaces on campus. So the man disagrees with the plan for the reasons stated above. (110 words)The university has decided to stop its free bus service because not many students ride the bus and plans to use the money saved to expand the overcrowded parking lots. But the man in the conversation doesn’t like the plan. As for the point about few students riding the bus, the man says it’s because the bus routes are out of date. The bus only goes through the places that are too expensive for students to live. If the buses change route and the man thinks there will be plenty of students taking those buses. The man also disagrees with the university’s plan to expand the parking lots. He thinks the plan will encourage more students to drive, which will add noise and create more traffic. Then they’ll need more parking space. He thinks the university should make it easier for students to take the public buses not the other way around.</li>

<p><center><strong>Hot Breakfasts Eliminated</strong></center><br>Beginning next month, Dining Services will no longer serve hot breakfast foods at university dining halls. Instead, students will be offered a wide assortment of cold breakfast items in the morning. These cold breakfast foods, such as breads, fruit, and yogurt, are healthier than many of the hot breakfast items that we will stop serving, so health-conscious students should welcome this change. Students will benefit in another way as well, because limiting the breakfast selection to cold food items will save money and allow us to keep our meal plans affordable.</p>

<ul>
<li>Well, the woman disagrees with the announcement for two main reasons. For one thing she believes that students will need hot food from time to time. For example on cold mornings students will need hot food like hot cereal more than cold food like yogurt. Secondly she argues that the students will go off-campus to pay more prices to get what they want due to the cutting back of meals. As a result the cost will actually add up and is therefore a worse situation for the students. All in all, the woman disagrees with the announcement for the reasons stated above. (103 words)Dining services will not serve hot breakfast food anymore. They only serve cold breakfast food. The woman in the conversation thinks the change is ridiculous. First of all, she thinks whether something is hot or cold doesn’t necessarily mean it is healthy. She says that in a really cold morning, a nice warm omelet is obviously better than a bowel of cold cereal. Secondly, she thinks the change will not help save money. Because if the students can’t get what they want from dining hall, they will go off-campus. Then they have to pay off-campus price, which is more expensive. So this change will not help save money but actually end up costing more.</li>

<p><center><strong>Evening Computer Classes May Be Added</strong></center><br>The computer department is considering offering evening classes in the fall. The proposal to add the classes is a response to student complaints that daytime computer classes have become increasingly overcrowded and there are no longer enough computers available. The department has decided that despite some added expense, the most cost-effective way of addressing this problem is by adding computer classes in the evening. It is hoped that this change will decrease the number of students enrolled in day classes and thus guarantee individual access to computers for all students in computer classes.</p>

<ul>
<li>Well, the man is strongly against the changing plan for two main reasons. First, he insists that most of the students are busy at night with such as jobs, families, clubs and so on, so they won’t be able to make good use of the added class anyway. Second, he believes that the idea of hiring more teachers to keep the academic building open later at night would be a bad idea. Since the computer prices have been reduced, it’s surely cheaper to invest in more computers. More importantly there is enough space in the building for holding more computers. So the man disagrees with the plan for the reasons stated above. (110 words)The Computer Department proposes to add evening computer classes because daytime computer classes have become overcrowded. But the man in the conversation thinks it’s a bad proposal. The man says that most of the students have already got their own plans in the evenings. They have jobs, family, clubs and social events so they won’t have time to attend the evening classes. The man also says that it’s actually going to cost more to open evening classes than to simply buy more computers, since to open new classes need to hire new teachers. However, computer is not expensive now. Plus, the computer classrooms are big enough to hold more computers. So he thinks buying more computers is a better way to solve the problem.</li>

During the last week of each semester, the dining hall will feature special meals prepared by the university’s culinary arts students. The school feels that this will give students who are studying cooking and food preparation valuable experience that will help them later, when they pursue careers.

<ul>
<li>The man agrees with the university’s plan for two main reasons. First of all, he thinks it’s a very good practice for the culinary art students. For them cooking in class is a lot easier than cooking for classmates in the dining hall, because while cooking in class they can take their time, but cooking in the dining hall is quite a different atmosphere, a more stressful one. The second reason from the man is that the culinary art students would make fantastic meals which are gonna be cheaper, and thus the students could save more money not dinning out in some of the expensive restaurants. (101 words)The man thinks it’s a great idea to let the culinary students to cook meals in the Campus Dining Club. His first reason is that it’s good for students in the culinary program. His cousin is in the program and says preparing meals for a large number of people is very different from just cooking in the classes. Because cooking in classes, you can just take time, but cooking for many people, you have a lot of pressure and might make mistakes. So it’s a very a good practice for them. His second reason is that even with the extra cost, the meals provided by these students are still much cheaper than that of the fancy restaurants in the town. But the food will be equally good. He thinks it’ll be worth it.</li>

<p><center><strong>History Seminars Should Be Shorter</strong></center><br>Currently, all of the seminar classes in the history department are three hours long. I would like to propose that history seminars be shortened to two hours. I make this proposal for two reasons. First, most students just cannot concentrate for three hours straight. I myself have taken these three-hour seminars and found them tiring and sometimes boring. Also, when a seminar lasts that long, people stop concentrating and stop learning, so the third hour of a three-hour seminar is a waste of everyone’s time. Two-hour seminars would be much more efficient.</p>

<li>Well, the woman strongly disagrees with the proposal for two main reasons. Firstly, she believes that the problem of concentration is not typically shared by most of the students who just have regular routines of study and rests. Instead, the problem only lies in Tim’s individual habits due to his partying late at night. Secondly, the woman feels that the last hour of seminar is the most worthwhile part of everything, for the reason that students usually get involved in the discussion and start exchanging important ideas. So based on all that reasons, the woman is strongly against the proposal. (103 words)Tim proposes to shorten the seminar to two hours because most students can’t concentrate for three hours straight and students stop learning at the third hour. The woman in the conversation totally disagrees with the proposal. She says Tim is not a typical student. He stays up late every night and that’s why he can’t concentrate in the seminar. But most students aren’t like him. They all come to seminars with good rests and preparation. Also, Tim always sleeps in the classes. He doesn’t know that the third hour of a seminar is the most important part because that’s when students begin discussions and start to exchange ideas.

<p><center><strong>Sculpture Courses to Be Discontinued</strong></center><br>University administrators announced yesterday that the sculpture program, a division of the art department, will be eliminated. “The main reason is a lack of student interest,” reported one administrator. “Although the number of art students has increased, fewer and fewer art majors are taking sculpture classes.” Furthermore, the department’s only sculpture professor is retiring this year. “Given the art department’s limited budget,’’ the administrator explained, “it just doesn’t make sense to hire a new full-time professor to teach sculpture for only a handful of students.”</p>

<li>Well, the woman totally disagrees with the university’s plan for several reasons. First of all, she believes that the students have got so many requirements that they wont have enough time to take the classes mentioned in the plan, not for the reason that art major students don’t want to enroll in these classes. And she adds that the art major students need more options for their own personal interests. Secondly, she thinks that the plan is drastic because money is not the problem. The university could hire a part-time professor or try asking the current professors who teach painting to work in their secondary fields. For example she argues that a few painting teachers could as well be excellent sculptors. In a word, the woman disagrees with the plan for the reasons stated above. (134 words)The university is planning to discontinue the sculpture course because students lack interest in it and the department’s only professor is retiring. The woman in the conversation thinks the university has got it all wrong. The low enrollment in the sculpture course is not due to students’ lack of interest but to students’ lack of time. Sculpture course is optional. The required courses such as painting and drawing take much of the students’ time. Besides, the woman thinks the university can hire a part-time teacher to teach sculpture course. There are many professors who have secondary fields. For instance, many painting teachers are also good sculptors. The woman is sure that these professors can teach the sculpture course.</li>

Secondly, the man believes that most students just don’t like classical music, so he thinks even if there is classical music broadcasting out loud, the students will still plug in their own mp3 players and listen to their own preference to avoid the broadcast classical music and stuff like that.

<li>Well, the woman disagrees with the announcement. She doesn’t think it’ll do any help to the students for some reasons. Firstly, she doesn’t think leadership and organization skills are something that students can acquire through the experience because all that many students, like her elder brother, do, is some basic and meaningless tasks like typing or filing stuff. The second reason from the woman is that other universities in her area have the same requirement as her university does, which means there are lots of competitors at the same positions especially when the business students graduate. There won’t be enough full-time job opportunities or positions available at all. So the woman virtually disagrees for the reasons stated above. (118 words)The business apartment will now require all students to have one semester work experience in a local company so that students can develop leadership and organizational skills and may secure permanent employment after graduation. The woman in the conversation doesn’t think the policy will help students. Firstly, the students don’t do the work that can develop leadership and organizational skills. Typically, students are there to do basic jobs such as typing and filing. Secondly, there are many other universities in this area that have the same requirements so there must be a lot of students holding the same positions.

<li>Well according to the proposal, the student’s suggesting that the university should display the students’ paintings and other artworks at the entrance to the students’ center. However the woman disagrees with that proposal for two main reasons. First of all, she thinks the entrance of the students’ center is crowded with people coming and going, which will block the views of the displays and is very distracting. Secondly, she believes that the displays need controlled lights like art museum to keep the light always at the same level instead of the natural light from windows which is changing all the time, either too bright or too dark. So based on the reasons given above the woman disagrees with the proposal. (126 words)In the letter, the student proposes to put the artworks in the lobby at the entrance to the student center, because the center has many students and is full of natural light. But the girl in the conversation doesn’t agree with it. For the first point about many students passing through student center, she thinks the number of students coming and going is huge, which could be distracting for people to view the artworks. The center is always crowded with people. It’s hard to appreciate the artworks with so many people around.  For the second point about natural light, she thinks it’s not very good. If it’s a sunny day, it’ll be way too bright. If it’s a cloudy day, it’ll be way too dark. Instead, the artworks need consistent light like the electric light in an art museum because the electric light is always carefully controlled and stays at a same level.</li>

<li>Actually?the woman opposes the college’s plan for some reasons. First of all, all the constructions in the plan will cause a lot of noise which will disturb the students when they are trying to get some sleep or to work constantly, so the students could possibly move out to avoid the noise, which means the campus will lose more students instead of getting more of them staying. Another reason from the woman is that the campus housing cost will be way too much for the students to afford, so they will move out and rent an apartment for a lower price. So based on the reasons stated above the woman disagrees with the plan. (112 words)The college is planning to renovate the dormitories in order to attract more students to remain on campus. The woman thinks the plan is a mistake. The woman says that the constructions will create too much noise and will constantly disturb students who are now living on campus. So it’s possible that more students will choose to live off-campus. She also says that the new campus housing is going to cost more because the college plans to use the students’ housing fees to pay for the renovations. So students won’t be able to afford to live on campus. They may still choose to rent an apartment off-campus. So the college may not achieve its goal to attract more students to remain on campus.</li>

Besides, the woman says this change will benefit the whole university. Since her friend’s university started a similar change five years ago and make a lot of money out of commercials.

<li>Well, the woman disagrees with the plan for two main reasons. In the first place, she believes that such amount of money could be wisely spent in some other places in order to attract more top students. For example, she says, the university could use the funds to update the outdated equipment in the lab, get more books for the library and try to enlarge the students’ center, which she thinks will virtually attract more top students. Secondly, she also holds the point that people from the town didn t come to the game of the university just because the teams of the university are too lose, not because of the places of the game, which means just building a stadium would not do much help, since people won’t change their impressions overnight. So based on the reasons stated above the woman disagrees with the plan of the university. (147 words)The university is planning to build a new athletic stadium in order to attract more top students and to strengthen its relationship with the town. The woman doesn’t think it’ll work. Firstly, the woman thinks some of the conditions on campus are too bad to attract top students. For example, science labs have outdated equipment, library not enough books and student center being too small. Secondly, the woman says that since our teams always lose, people in the town rarely come to watch the games. And it’s impossible that the teams improve overnight. Besides, adding seats won’t help either. People in the town won’t come to stadium just because it is bigger. So building this new stadium is not going to improve the relationship with the town. </li>

First of all, he argues that it’s safer for people to run repeatedly on a trail with soft surface than on a paved one, simply because it’ll do less damage and injuries to human bodies. Besides, he is against the proposal’s second opinion mainly because students will take a break for walking on the trail, since it’s more natural and students would have a chance to relax.

The man in the conversation thinks the proposal is a terrible idea. As for the thing about making trails safer, the man says the writer doesn’t think about the long-term consequences of running on a hard surface.

Additionally, the cubicles will enable the library to accommodate the recent increase in the number of students attending our university.

<li>The man disagrees with the upcoming change for two main reasons. First of all, he believes the students would have nowhere to get together for their group projects in the library, so he figures that the money should be spent on building meeting rooms instead of buying new units to reduce the noise in the main library area. Besides, he thinks that there is no such problem as overcrowding. He says there are empty tables all the time in the library even when the university enrolls in more students, and therefore replacing the tables would be a waste of money, since there is quite sufficient room for the students who use the library. So the man thinks that the upcoming change is quite a mistake. (127 words)The library is going to change big, multi-person study tables into personal study cubicles in order to eliminate noise in the library and accommodate more students attending the university. The man in the conversation thinks the university is making a mistake. As for the first purpose to reduce distraction, the man says if there is no multi-person tables in the library, there will be no place to get together to do group projects. He thinks instead of changing tables, the university should build meeting rooms to reduce the noise in the main library hall. As for the second purpose to accommodate more students, the man says the library has no problem with overcrowding. He sees empty tables all the time and the woman always takes a whole table for herself. The man thinks it’ll be a waste of money to build the cubicles since the library now is sufficiently big to hold more students. </li>

<p><center><strong>University Choir to Enter Off-Campus Singing Competitions</strong></center><br>Currently, the university choir gives singing concerts only on campus. Next year, however, the choir will add competitive events at other locations to its schedule. The choir’s new director feels that entering singing competitions will make the quality of the choir’s performance even better than it is now. “Competitions will motivate students in the choir to pursue a higher standard of excellence in singing,” he said. In addition, it is hoped that getting the choir off campus and out in the public will strengthen the reputation of the university s music program. This in turn will help the program grow.</p>

<li>According to the article, the university choir will add competitive events at other locations to its schedule, and the man agrees with the change for two main reasons. First of all, he believes that such a change will motivate the students because some other schools are good, and the students in the choir will have to work hard to go up against them. He believes that the students will even work harder; they’d perhaps rehearse more often singing the line. The second reason for the man’s preference is that even though the program is small, there are talented people in the program and if students go to off-campus events and win the public attention, their performance could attract more people to both the university and the musical program. So the man is looking forward to the change for the reasons stated above. (144 words)The university choir decides to enter off-campus singing competition in order to better its performance and help the music program grow. The man in the conversation likes this plan. Firstly, he thinks this change will motivate the singers in the choir. Since other schools’ choirs are very good, the university choir has to work harder to compete against them. So the university choir may practice more often than did it before and thus better the performance. Secondly, he says if the choir goes to those off-campus events, there will be many students listening to them and if the students feel good, they may choose to come to the university and join the program. Therefore, the music program will grow.</li>

Individual members of a group attempt to conform their opinions to what they believe to be the group consensus even though the result may be negative. There are many reasons why groupthink happens. These include the desire to be liked, fear of losing a job, or even not wanting to be the one employee delaying a decision that seems inevitable.

<li>Group think is a process by which groups may make bad or irrational decisions as its members try to conform to the assumed group consensus. And the professor takes his own experience in a computer company a couple of years ago. One day he and his co-worker proposed to change the design of their computer to attract more customers. This suggestion was first supported by most of the group while rejected by a few senior managers who thought the move was unnecessary. But then many of the group, including his co-worker, began to change their mind because they didn’t want to ruin their chances of promotion by disagreeing with the senior managers. So finally there was only the professor who held up the vote, and he began to doubt whether his insistence was worthwhile. As all people sided with the senior managers, he gave up this idea and the whole group decided to stay with the current design. However, this decision cost them a lot of money as their competitors adopted a new design on the same year which won over their customers. (182 words)</li>

The study of social interaction is concerned with the influence people have over one another’s behavior. People take each other into account in their daily behavior and in fact, the very presence of others can affect behavior. For example, one principle of social interaction, audience effects, suggests that individuals’ work is affected by their knowledge that they are visible to others, that the presence of others tends to alter the way people behave or perform an activity.</p>

<li>Audience effects suggest that with the knowledge that they’re being watched while working, people usually alter their behavior during their work. And the professor illustrates the principle with two studies that suggest this. In the first study, two groups of students were asked to put on shoes that they had to tie, one group being told later that they would be observed, while the other group being kept in dark. So when the researchers began to observe, they found that the group aware of the observation tied faster than the other group. This study shows how audience effects speed up people’s action. While the second study suggests that when people are learning new things, with the awareness of being observed, they will not only accelerate, but also increase certain behavior pattern. For instance, when they learn to type, they’ll type faster, but meanwhile make more mistakes. (141 words)The principle of audience effects is that individuals’ performance is affected by the knowledge that others are watching them. The professor uses examples of tying shoes and learning to type to demonstrate that we actually increase our speed of performing if we know that we are being observed. In the example of tying shoes, one group of college students was told that they were being observed, the other didn’t know they were being observed. The students who knew they were being watched tied their shoes much faster than the other group. And in the example of learning to type, when we are conscious of being observed, we will increase typing speed. We type faster than we do alone. Also, other behavioral pattern will increase, like making mistakes. So when we type faster when we know we are being observed, we also make more mistakes.</li>

When he was a freshman in high school he was addicted to video games, and he didn’t study very much. So he failed his chemistry class that was difficult for him. He was caught in a dilemma between his belief and his action, that is, on the one hand, he understood that he could only find a good job if he did well in school, while on the other, he just couldn’t give up video games. The professor’s solution was to change his perspective by thinking that the only thing he was bad at in school was chemistry, and since he wanted to become a sociologist rather than a chemist, it didn’t really matter if he could do well in chemistry. Being successful, to him, was just doing well in subjects related to his future career, and this was how cognitive dissonance he|ped the professor eliminate the conflict in his mind.

That is, when our non-verbal message agrees with the verbal one, the verbal message is enhanced. For example, when the professor’s favorite uncle surprisingly visited him, he told his uncle he was very happy. Meanwhile his eyes got really wide open, and he broke into a huge smile and even jumped up and down like a little boy, so his uncle felt very good about it, too. However, when our non-verbal message conflicts with the verbal one, it can communicate more messages than our words. For example, when the professor taught his daughter to use hammer and nails, he accidentally hurt his finger. Even though he told his daughter he was OK, his daughter didn’t believe him because he kept shaking his hand as it could reduce the pain, his face distorted and his voice trembled, which suggests he was actually in pain. (174 words)The professor uses his two experiences to illustrate the relationship between verbal and nonverbal communication. In his first experience, his uncle visited him. Since he hadn’t seen his uncle for a long time, when he saw his uncle, he said “What a surprise！” and because he was so happy that he jumped like a little boy and had a huge smile on his face. His uncle felt good because of his words and actions. Since the professor’s verbal message agrees with his nonverbal signals, the verbal message is enhanced. In his second experience, when he was showing his daughter how to use a hammer, he smashed his thumb. He said to his daughter “Don’t worry, honey. It’s nothing.” but at the same time he was shaking his hand and his face was contorted. His daughter kept asking him if he was okay. Because the professor’s verbal message doesn’t agree with his nonverbal message, the communication is totally different.</li>

<li>Targeted marketing is an effective marketing strategy, that is, a company advertises the product to a smaller and more specific audience so it’s more likely to attract the customers in need. For example, a cellphone company may show a cellphone commercial emphasizing its variety of colors and entertainment functions during entertainment programs for young people like pop concerts or the like, since the audience then are usually teenagers, and they’re very likely to be fascinated and ask their parents to buy the fun phone for them. However, the company may also create a different commercial that shows how convenient and productively helpful the phone is and put it during the business news hour to attract business people. According to the two examples, the cellphone company can maximize the sales of its cellphones with the help of target marketing. (137 words)Target marketing is a strategy of advertising to smaller, specific customers. The professor uses a cell-phone company as an example. If the company wants to sell phones to young people, it’ll choose to put a TV commercial in the programs that young people like to watch and in the commercial, the phone is shown to be cool and has a bright color. Also, in the commercial, kids are having a good time with their friends. If the company wants to appeal to businessmen, it’ll put a different TV commercial in a business program. Besides, the commercial will show how the cell-phone can handle all business efficiently and can save money. So it’s basically the same cell-phone, but the company makes two different commercials to attract two specific groups of people.</li>

Many people drove by the billboard and saw it. However, when the researchers asked the drivers if they saw any car ad on the road, they couldn’t remember it. Then, the researchers asked these people to name an animal starting with the letter “p”?and surprisingly, they all said panther instead of “pig”?which is the most common animal starting with the letter “p” . This research suggests that even though implicit memories can’t be aware of, it’s there and still affects people.

They don’t remember all the billboards but the billboards affect them. Suppose there is a car advertisement with its name panther above its picture. A lot of drivers passed it by. Later, when asked whether they remember seeing any car advertisements, the drivers will say no because they honestly don’t remember. They don’t have conscious memory of the panther billboard. But if asked to name an animal starting with a letter “P”, drivers will say “panther”. So the car billboard had effect on them.</li>

And they learn the unpleasant consequence of their misbehavior so they will stop doing this.

<li>“Establishing shot is a far-away image shown at the beginning of a film scene that is used to communicate background information and create mood feelings. The professor takes a film he used to see as an example. At the beginning of the film, he saw an image of a big city, and in the city there were lots of tall buildings, skyscrapers as well as old-fashioned cars and signs. All of these told him that the story took place in the 1940s in a big city. Then he noticed that the city was gloomy, because there wasn’t much light, only a bit light from the street lamp. Besides, it rained and fogged. So the whole scene seemed dark, gloomy and mysterious. When the action started and the detectives began to talk, he already knew that the story took place in a tall building, in a 1940s big city, and the story was dark and mysterious because of what he saw in the establishing shot. (163 words)”Establishing shot is an image shown briefly at the beginning of a scene in order to communicate background information to viewers and establish mood or feeling of the scene. The professor uses a movie he recently watched as an example. At the beginning of the movie, you can see an image of a city with tall buildings, skyscrapers. In the city the cars and signs are old-fashioned. It seems like the city is in the 1940s. Also, before the scene started, the city seemed gloomy. It was mostly darkness, with little light from street lamps and it was raining, kind of foggy. These give viewers a dark, gloomy mysterious feeling. So when detectives are talking in an office, the professor had already known that the scene is a located in tall building, big city, sometime in the 1940s and the event is dark, gloomy and mysterious.</li>

<p><center><strong>Entertainment Merchandising</strong></center><br>An effective, widely used marketing practice in the entertainment industry is entertainment merchandising. Entertainment merchandising is a form of marketing in which the brand or image from one product is also used to sell another. The practice of entertainment merchandising often occurs in connection with movies and television shows, especially those associated with children. For example, the success of a popular children’s television show may result in the marketing of toys that are designed to look like characters in the show. Or the situation may be reversed when a children’s television show is written to include characters that are based on already-popular toys.</p>

<li>Entertainment merchandising is an effective way of marketing in which a brand or an image from one product is used to sell another. And this is usually used in shows and movies connected with children. For example, when the professor was a kid, he and his friends really enjoyed a TV character called action hero. And they usually played together, pretending to be action heros . So when the toy that featured action heros came out, they all wanted it, and it was already popular from the onset. This is how entertainment merchandising markets a new toy with a popular TV show. In another example, however, the situation is reversed. The professor’s daughter loves to play a cute little baby doll called Rosa, since it’s very popular among little girls. When the TV show features Rosa as its main character, it becomes immediately successful, just like the action hero toy. (129 words)Entertainment merchandising is a marketing practice using the brand or image from one product to sell another. The professor uses two examples to illustrate this practice. The first example is that when he was a kid, his friends and he liked a character named Action Hero and they always watched the Action Hero program on Television and played games pretending to be the powerful hero. After a time, they started to see small hero figures in all the stores. They all watched the TV show so long that it was natural they wanted to buy the toys. The second example is that his 7-year-old daughter and her friends like a cute little baby doll named Rosa. One day his daughter told him that a new TV program with Rosa as the main character would show every week. Naturally, she and her friends all started to watch the television show which was already popular, as popular as the toy doll.</li>

<li>Outsider art is used to describe art works made by people who choose to live and work outside the society. These works are usually very unique because the artists are barely trained. For example, Henry Dodger was an artist who lived far away from people in Chicago in the 1900s, and he had never received any formal artistic education, so his work was very unique. What’s more, he didn’t have any friends and kept his work private during his lifetime. In one of his water painting that describes the adventure of seven children, he had difficulty drawing figures, so he solved the problem by cutting off figures from newspapers and magazines and pasted them on the illustration of trees, flowers and grass that he painted. As a result, his painting often looks a little strange?more cluttered because its entire surface is painted. And it’s also longer than any other works, about nine feet long. That’s why Henry Dodger is considered as an outsider artist. (165 words)According to the reading passage, outsider artists work in isolation and don’t get formal artistic training and they also invent their own ways of doing things. Therefore, their work may look strange and can be very different from other artists’. According to the professor, Henry Darger lived by himself, had no friends and thus worked in isolation. Also, He never received any formal training and his work is very unique. Darger had a hard time painting figures but he managed to come up with his own method. He cut out pictures of children from newspapers and pasted them on the painting. So his painting looks a little strange. It’s more cluttered and more crowded with details than other artists’ paintings. Also because the entire space is painted, Darger’s painting is a lot longer than other artists.</li>

Then the researcher shows both groups a third picture of the boy in which the boy’s holding the cake without any expression.

In spite of this, even as conditions change and we see objects differently, we still recognize that they remain the same. This is what is known as perceptual constancy.

<li>Perceptual constancy is the phenomenon that however the external conditions affect our perception of an object, we still recognize it. According to the professor, there’re two examples of this. The first one is about angle. When you hold a plate upright to your face, you see a perfect circle. But if a plate is placed horizontally, it stretches out, and flattens into an oval. Anyway, no matter what shape we see, we always know that it’s the same plate because of perceptual constancy. Another example is about distance. We all know that if someone is far away from us, he/she appears smaller. Otherwise he/she appears bigger and taller. So if a student sits in the front row, hell see a bigger and taller professor. But if he sits in the back, he will see a smailer professor. Bigger or smaller he still knows that it’s the same professor due to perceptual constancy. (158 words)Perceptual Constancy is our ability to recognize the same object in many different contexts, even if the object may look different in different contexts. The professor uses two examples to illustrate this ability. The first example is plate. If we put a round plate directly at our face, it is a perfect circle. But if we put it in a horizontal position, it is no longer a circle but an oval. Still we recognize it as the same plate. The oval one is not a different object. Even if it looks different, we still perceive it as the same. The second example is the professor himself. He looks bigger to the students in the front row than those in the back row. If a student sits in the front row today and then in the back row tomorrow, the student will still perceive him as the same professor, even if to the student the professor’s size has changed.</li>

However, he couldn’t find a job as a film reviewer, so he became a news reporter instead. It wasn’t easy for him to become a journalist at first, but when he adapted himself to the job, he realized that he was actually good at it, and therefore a job reporter became his comfort zone.

Then he took a position as a news reporter, investigating stories and writing about events. At first, he wasn’t sure he would be good at this but he adjusted, gained confidence and became a pretty good reporter.

And it took two hours less time to train the supposedly smarter monkey because he tried to communicate with them, frequently smiled at them, encouraged them, and talked to them.

<li>The lecture mainly talks about ritualization, a process by which a practical behavior in animals develops into a communicative one. The professor uses the example of dogs showing their teeth to explain it. Originally, dogs showed their teeth before they were going to bite to avoid biting their own lips. Then other animals learned that dogs always showed their teeth before they bit, so they began to read it as a warning signal and they would stay away the dogs after they saw this. As this happened again and again, the dog realized that it didn’t have to bite to protect itself, and showing teeth is enough to keep other animals away, so they began to use it as a warning signal. This is how the dog showing its teeth has been ritualized. (132 words)Ritualization is a process in which an animal’s behavior that originally serves a practical purpose develops into one that communicates a specific message. The professor use dog’s baring teeth as an example to explain the concept. If dogs feel threatened, they show their teeth, meaning stay away. Before this dog’s behavior become a recognizable warning, its original purpose is to avoid biting its own lips. When dogs sense danger, they bite and instinctively bare teeth to avoid biting their own lips. But other animals over time notice the teeth baring behavior always came before a dog’s going to bite. So they started to read it as a signal to be careful. After this scenario repeated time after time, dogs themselves start to be aware that simply baring teeth is enough to protect themselves. So they use this behavior as a warning signal to communicate the possibility to attack rather than actually attack.</li>

<li>Relict behavior refers to a kind of behavior in animals that was critical to their survival a long time ago but serve no purpose now due to the change of the environment. In the lecture, the professor takes the American pronghorn that lives in North America. It’s known as the fastest animal in the western hemisphere, and none of its present predators, like bobcat or coyote, can catch up with it. However, the pronghorn was fast for a reason a long time ago. Tens of thousands of years ago, there were lions on the grassland, and lions preyed on pronghorns. Since lions were very fast, the pronghorns, in order to survive, had to run for their life. That was how the pronghorn gained its speed. However, lions were extinct then, so the primary reason for the pronghorn’s speed was gone. But the behavior remained, and became what’s known as relict behavior. (153 words)Relict behavior no longer serves its original purpose because of changed conditions. It might be useful to the animal when habitat was different. Pronghorn lives on open grassy plains. It is superfast, actually the fastest animal in the western hemisphere. Whenever its predators appear, it’s off in a flash. The reason why it runs so fast is that long time along, the grassy plain was different. Lions used to live there and chased pronghorns. Lions were much faster than bobcat, so pronghorn’s speed was critical to its survival. But now lions are extinct. They are no longer the predators. Because of this condition change, pronghorn’s speed doesn’t serve its original purpose and thus becomes a relict behavior.</li>
