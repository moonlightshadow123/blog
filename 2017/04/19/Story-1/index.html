        <p>This is the first part of the story.<br><a id="more"></a><br>Noah Bowman woke up in a strange desert wit his ragged cloth. He can’t remember anything about the past, except the blurry uproar outside of his house. It seemed he was abandoned here by someone, leaving him nothing but half bottle of water. He picked up the bottle, and as he bend over, a sudden dizziness stroke him and almost knocked him into unconsciousness again. He struggled to raise again on his feet, staggered for a few minutes before he could walk normally.     </p>
<p>Torrid sun torched the desolate desert, alone with the unbearable heat wave lashing millions of sand tunes. He started to examine the hellish place he ended up in. There’s barely living vegetation above the boiling surface, not to mention any human inhabitation.  </p>
<p>Bowman looked around in despair. “Oh, God, please save me.” He murmured to himself. Half bottle of water won’t last for a day in such arid, dilapidated area, so finding more water to drink was his top priority. And as a former sailor, he was deeply aware of the significance of freshwater. He swept the unpopulated in sight, like flipping though a book of survival. </p>
<p>Oh man, there’s nothing but sand and gravel. Wait, wait, what’s the fuzzy-flossy darkness on the edge of horizon, and the tiny-tiny little black spot over there. Maybe that’s my only change of survival. Let’s check it out. It’s better something than nothing at all.</p>
<p>So Bowman headed towards the fuzziness with all his flickering hope. </p>
<p>Bowman’s father was a noted anthologist, and he complied a lot of poems and essays. Bowman was set out to be a poet or a anthologist at the first time. As a young boy he was weedy and emaciated, his farther feared that he was unfit for the fierce competition out there in modern society. He distinctly recalled that his father commanded him to finish all the reading of the piled-up anthologies, memories and manifestos of classical literature, but it was Thanks-giving and he really want to join the convivial dinner. So he was increasingly inattentive to his accumulative collecting of the ‘literary bouquet’. Life was so pointless at that time, he was too fatigued to follow his father’s timeworn instruction, and too naive to explore a new field that he could throw all his heart in. Then he met his life coach (at least Bowie think so), Noel Collins. Noel was a great explorer to follow and even Bowman’s father did not approximate Noel in terms of the impact on Bowman. Noel was retiring back then, as a esteemed adventurer. The stately but often empty house beside Bowman’s comparatively cramped and crowded house was Noel’s settlement after his inspiring and heartening life journey. Noel invited Bowman’s family to his retirement ceremony. It was a great party for all walks of life, at least in the small town. Lots of locally renowned entrepreneurs and journalist of both provincial and metropolitan newspapers teemed the house, and Bowman even saw himself on local TV when Noel was narrating his compelling personal stories. Bow was so awed by the ceremony that he decided to be an explorer like Noel. So he visited Noel after the party and expressed his reverence and asked for guidance. Noel didn’t know his neighbor very well, but out of decorum, he offered Bowman a job as a sailor on his ship. Bowman took the job with ecstasy, and became a sailor since then, even though his obdurate father was slow coming to terms with the fact that his anemic son would embark on a risky and perilous career. And for Bowie, it was a new life, brand-new hope grown out of the ashes of the finally deceased mediocrity. However, Bowman needs that kind of hope now, to step out of bleak desert…</p>
