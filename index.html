<li>Well, the woman’s problem is that she is supposed to drive a bunch of kids to the zoo tomorrow but she couldn’t rent a van. Accordingly, the man offers two solutions: she could perhaps borrow a car form one of her friends for the trip, or she could try public transportation instead. Well I think the woman should try public transportation for two reasons. Safety would be the first reason of my recommendation. The tour bus drivers are generally more experienced and professional especially when carrying a bunch of kids. All she needs to do is to focus on keeping the kids safe and cheered up, so it will be a lot easier and more manageable. Comparatively speaking, it’s undoubtedly more dangerous for the woman to plan some self-driving trip, letting alone carrying a bunch of kids. Irresponsible, I’d say, if anything bad happens. All in all, I strongly recommend the public transportation as a better option. (160 words)</li>

<li>Well, the woman’s got a problem that she is now invited by her professor to a field trip but it conflicts with the museum exhibition which she is helping setting up. There are two solutions for the woman to solve the problem. She could ask her professor to find scxne other student to the field trip or she could hurry up to finish setting up the museum exhibition ahead of time so that she could go to the trip after that. I guess the woman should take the second solution for two reasons. First of all, field trips are usually the most helpful activities of our study life, especially during our break. We students could put everything we learned into real practice, to prove and to test results and conclusions from the classes and textbooks, so any student should not miss any field trips. Secondly, she could speed up her setting up the museum exhibition by asking others for some help especially with the trivial work and the details, and therefore I am sure she could finish her work with the museum set-up before the field trip. (186 words)The professor asks the woman to attend a field trip, but the woman has already promised another professor to help set up a museum exhibition next week. And this is the problem. The professor offers two possible solutions. The first is that she can talk to the other professor to see if there is someone else who can replace the woman to help set up the museum exhibition. The second is that the woman finishes setting up the museum before they set out the field trip. Actually, I think the woman should choose the second solution, because she has already agreed to help the other professor and the other professor is counting on her. It’s possible that there is no one else who can take her place. So she’d better finish the task first before she goes to the field trip.</li>

<li>Well, the woman’s problem is that her award ceremony conflicts with her coming biology exam, and accordingly the man offers two solutions for the woman: first, she could talk to her professor about the schedule conflict or second, she could find someone else to receive the award for her. In such a dilemma, l believe the second solution is a better one for two main reasons. Fcx one thing, a five-page paper is even more time appealing and exhausting than her biology exam, because it is known to all that students could easily get an exam cracked within like no more than 5 days but it usually takes at least more than 2 weeks to get a paper done. Second, finding someone to receive the award would be really easy—maybe a phone call will do and still the woman could get her award. (148 words)The woman won an award and is invited to attend the award ceremony. But her biology exam is scheduled at the same time. So she is struggling about what to do. There are two possible solutions. The first one is that she could write a 5-page paper instead of taking the exam. But she thinks writing a paper will take more time than preparing for and taking an exam. She’s got many other things to do. The second solution is that she could ask someone else to receive the award on her behalf. But her parents were really looking forward to seeing her on the stage. Still, she’s struggling. Well, I would recommend her to choose the first solution. Since she doesn’t want to disappoint her parents, she has to try harder to win the time to attend the ceremony even though it’ll take her more time to write the paper. It’s the trade-off.</li>

<li>The man’s problem is that as a freshman he couldn’t find his way to his class because he left his class schedule in his dorm. Accordingly the woman offers two solutions for the man: first he could go to the student center to check the room number for his class on a computer. Second he could try his luck checking every room for his class in this building. Well, in such a dilemma I think the man should go straight to the student center to check his classroom because the student center is not too far from where he stays and he will definitely get precise information on the computer. If he hurries he will just be on time. Secondly, checking each room would be rude and abrupt and more importantly time-wasting, especially for such a huge building: the right room could be the last room he tries in this building and he could probably be late. So I agree that the man should go to the student center to check information up. (174 words)The man didn’t take his class schedule with him and it’s his first day in the college, so he couldn’t find his classroom. The woman offers two possible solutions. The first solution is that he can go to use the computer in the computer center to check the schedule. But it’ll take some time to go there and he doesn’t want to be late for his first class. The second solution is that he can just go to big classrooms in the building to check which one is the class he is going to take. But he thinks it’ll be embarrassing if he goes into a classroom and asks if he is in the right room. I would recommend him to go to the computer center, since he didn’t take his class schedule, it’s necessary to check all classes for the whole day. Maybe he’ll be late for his first class, but at least he won’t feel embarrassed for the rest of the day.</li>

<li>Well, the woman’s problem is that she sprained her wrist but she’s supposed to play the violin in her string quartet’s big concert next week. Accordingly she is thinking that maybe she could try playing anyway, or as the man suggested she should get someone to replace her. Well, I guess the woman should find some substitute for her quartet instead of playing by herself anyway. For one thing, sprained wrist is definitely a disaster for any violin player. If she does not take enough rest to recover her wrist completely, she’ll probably risk herself with some unpleasant consequences that she would feel sorry for some day in the future. Second, finding a substitude player will do good to her team. After all, a successful concert depends on healthy players’ team-work. So based on the reasons given above I think finding someone to replace the woman would be a better idea. (150 words)The woman sprained her wrest but she is supposed to play the violin in her string-quartet concert next week. Now she is upset. In the conversation, they talk about two possible solutions. The first one is that she can just wait and play the violin in the concert next week because her doctor says that she will be better when the concert begins. But she will be out of practice and probably perform badly. The second solution is that she can ask Jim to take her place. Jim is a very good violinist. But he is not very reliable, because he is always late for rehearsals. I recommend her to choose the second solution. Since she is definitely going to be out of practice, it’s better to ask Jim to take her place. And since she knows Jim’s problem, she can urge Jim to show up on time for all the rehearsals. It’s just only a week.</li>

<li>Well the woman’s problem is that the members of her study group have become very good friends but they are just joking around instead of studying and they don’t get much study work done. Accordingly, the man offers two solutions: first she could probably have her study group meet on another day instead of Friday; and second, her study group should have a leader. In my opinion, the woman’s ’study group should have a leader. Firstly, a leader of a study group could organize a clear and effective schedule for studying, and each time members meet, all they need to do is to follow the schedule and the leader will do the final check for the result of the group. Secondly, members could take turns to be a leader to make the study schedule of the group, which will be a better motivation for all members. (146 words)The woman’s studying group has got a problem. The members all become friends and they all joke around instead of studying. The professor proposes two possible solutions. The first solution is to change the time they meet. Currently, they meet on Friday afternoons, but students are exhausted at that time and they all want to relax and unwind at the end of a week. But the woman says everyone has already got their own schedule, if they change time, they may lose members. The second solution is to find a leader. The leader can set the agenda, email it to everyone else before the meeting and then make sure everyone is focused on the topic when they meet. The professor says the woman is suitable to be the leader. But it sounds like much work to the woman. I would recommend the woman to take the second solution. If she’s worrying about the work, she can just be a temporal leader and later let other members to do the work.</li>

<li>The woman’s problem is that her papers will be due by the end of next week but her computer won’t be fixed by then. Accordingly, the man offer two solutions: she could try using the computer lab or she could call the computer repair shop to check if they could get the computer fixed at the beginning of next week/ahead of time. Well, I guess go using the computer lab is a better idea for some reasons. To begin with, the computer lab is an exact place for students especially those who don’t even own a computer to write their papers. Therefore all she needs to do is to plan her personal study schedule and try to avoid the rush hour of the lab. I am sure if she tries hard to make good use of the study time, the atmosphere there in the lab would become a better motivation instead of obstacles for her paper writing. Secondly, calling back to the shop would be comparatively a bad idea. After all, begging others to reschedule their business plan is more difficult than refine our own study plan. So I would recommend the first solution for the reasons stated above. (201 words)The woman’s computer is broken and it won’t be back until the end of next week. But it’s now the end of semester, all her papers are due next week. The man gives her two possible solutions. The first solution is to go to computer club where there are lots of machines. But the woman thinks it’s so crowded and noisy that she can’t concentrate. The second solution is to call the repair shop to ask if they can fix the computer quickly and give it back to her at the beginning of next week. Then the woman will have enough time to finish her paper. But the repair shop is closed today and tomorrow. It’ll be a few days before the woman can talk to them. I would recommend her to choose the first solution. Since time is limited and it’s not sure whether her computer can be fixed in time, using the computer center is the only choice. Even though the computer center is crowded and noisy, it’s always possible to concentrate on work.</li>

<li>Well, the man’s problem is that he needs to take two required courses to get his degree since it’s his last semester, but those two courses just conflict in his schedule. Accordingly, there are two solutions for the man: first he could do an independent study to fulfill that requirement with the permission and help of the professor; and second, he could try the same course in another university. Well, I think the first solution is a better idea for two reasons. Firstly, independent study is an indispensable way of study in college life and has essentially no difference from class study, especially with the permission and help of the professor. The man could also use the study notes from students in class and do all the reading or researching assignment, which will promote his efficiency of studying. When he’s got any questions he could just go straight to the professor on the office hours as the professor promises. Secondly, going to another university is a bad idea mainly because that will be too time-consuming. So I agree with the first solution. (185 words)The man has to take two courses to fulfill the requirement but these two courses are scheduled at the same time. In the conversation, they talked about two possible solutions. The first solution is to do independent study in the Shakespeare course. He read texts, finish assignments on his own and have discussions with the professor. But he’s afraid that he won’t be motivated. The second solution is to take the Shakespeare course in another university. But it takes him one hour to drive back and forth the universities. I would recommend he to take the Shakespeare course in the other university. Since he won’t be motivated if he studies independently,this is a good way to motivate him. Although this will cost him some time and money, he will finish the course.</li>

<li>Well, the woman’s problem is that there’s something wrong with the water pipes in her house and it takes two weeks to fix the pipes so she has to move out to find some place for her mid-term preparation. Accordingly, there are two options for her to solve the problem: first, she could move to her friends’ place; and second, she could find a small hotel near her campus. I think, the second solution is a better idea. Firstly, going to a hotel means personal space and quiet study atmosphere so she will surely prepare herself well for her mid-term. Secondly, the hotel can cost on a weekly rate which is quite reasonable for the woman, so I think she can afford it for the sake of better concentration on study after class. After all the main duty of the students is to study. So based on the reasons stated above I agree and recommend the second solution. (153 words)The woman has to move out of her apartment right away because there is something wrong with the water pipe and it’s going to take about two weeks to fix it. Also, the mid-term exams are coming up. The first solution is to stay at some friends’ place. The woman can sleep on the living room couch. But their place has already got four people, it’ll be a little crowded. Plus, there will be many distractions. The second solution is live in a hotel near campus. She could get a room there. But her budget is very tight now, even if the weekly rate is reasonable, it’ll still end up costing her some money. Considering the options and problems, I would recommend her to choose the first solution. Since her budget is tight, living at the friends’ place can save her money. Concerning the problem of distractions, she can just study in classrooms and only sleep on the couch at night.</li>

<li>Well, the woman’s problem is that she has a history paper due tomorrow and her laptop’s battery is running out but there’s no electricity in her room to charge because of the storm. Accordingly, there are two solutions from the man: the first one is that she could go to a library in another city where she could get her lap top plugged in to continue her paper; second, she could ask her professor for an extension. Well, I guess the first solution is a better idea for some reasons. First of all, the library is not far away from the woman, and if she hurries, she could get the paper done and go home before the library close just in time. A library is a perfect place for study, and all she needs is to pack her computer and go driving, which surly beats staying home praying for the extension. Secondly, asking for an extension would be a bad idea. I think, after all there must be students going to the library or finding possible ways to get the paper done just on time, letting alone those who don’t have electricity at home. So I think the woman should go to the library to finish her paper. (206 words)The woman has a history paper due tomorrow and she has been writing it on her laptop, but the electricity went out and the battery is running low. What’s worse, the electricity won’t be back before several hours. The man suggests her to go to Jefferson City. It’s got electricity and there is library where she can plug in her laptop and it’s only about 20 minutes drive. But then she has to pack up all her stuff and it’s raining outside. Then the man gives another suggestion that she can just go to ask the professor for an extension. But the woman says the professor said he didn’t grant any extensions when he assigned the paper. Well, I would recommend the girl to drive to Jefferson City. Though she has to pack her stuff and it’s raining outside, finding a place to finish her paper is the most important thing to do. As a student, she has the responsibility to finish the homework. Accident caused by weather is not an excuse for not finishing homework on time.</li>

<li>Well, the man’s problem is that it’s too late for him to apply for a dorm room for the summer so he might have no place to live in. There are two solutions for the man: first, he could stay with his parents; and second, he could rent an apartment off campus. According to my understanding, renting an apartment is a better idea for the man for two reasons. First of all, renting an apartment is what most students do when they could not find a chance to live in a dorm, and for the man, it could save him gas fee for reference books or better food. Secondly, renting an apartment always means one could choose roommate for his or her own preference, especially finding someone who shares almost the same living habits And I am sure the man would like to live with someone he really gets along well with. So I think finding an apartment is a better option. (160 words)The man has got a summer research position on campus but he didn’t apply for a dorm room for the summer. And it’s too late to apply now. In the conversation, they talk about two possible solutions. The first one is that the man can stay with his parents and commute to campus every day. His parents will be happy to have him home and many old friends will come back home for the summer vacation. But it’s a little tiring to drive on the road. The second solution is to rent an apartment near campus. It saves time and gas fee. But still the man has to pay for the rent. Well, I would recommend the man to choose the first solution. Since his parents are happy to live with him and he can meet many old friends, why not stay with his parents. Even if it’s tiring to drive, he can save the money for the rent.</li>

<li>Well, the woman’s problem is that she hopes to attend an award ceremony but she has got her philosophy exam exactly before the ceremony. Accordingly, there are two solutions for the woman’s problem: first she could try to finish her exam just before the ceremony and hurry to the ceremony just in time; the second solution is that she could talk to the professor to take the test some other time. In such a dilemma I guess she should talk to the professor to get the exam rescheduled and there are two reasons. Firstly, she could try harder studying for her exam exactly from now on, so even if the exam might be rescheduled ahead of time her preparation is even earlier. By studying harder she could get full preparation for both the exam and her attendance of the ceremony that day. Secondly, hurrying to the ceremony would be suffering for both her exam and attendance of ceremony; she could probably get both ruined. So I guess talking to the professor to get the exam time changed is a wiser choice. (186 words)The woman won an award and is invited to attend the award ceremony. But she’s got a philosophy exam that is scheduled to end at the time when the ceremony begins. There are two possible solutions. The first one is to attend the ceremony after taking the philosophy exam since these ceremonies never start on time and give long introductions. So she won’t miss anything important. But she thinks it’s a bit risky and she doesn’t want to miss being there when they announce her name. The second solution is talk to the professor and reschedule the exam. But the professor always reschedule the exam earlier which means less studying time for the woman. I think the woman had better choose the first solution. Since rescheduling exam will reduce her studying time, the second solution will probably harm her score. Even if it’s possible that she’ll miss the announcement of her name, she can still go to the award after the exam.</li>

<li>Actually, the man’s problem is that her mom’s van is down, so he couldn’t take his club members to see the exhibit tomorrow. The woman offers two suggestions for the man: he could rent a van for that trip or he could postpone the trip till his mom’s car gets fixed up. Well, I think the man could rent a van. First, nobody would blame him, for not using his mom’s car, which indeed is a quite understandable emergency, since no one would share a trip on a van that needs repairing. Secondly, I am sure his friends, the club members would be glad to share the rent and the gas fee when they get together. After all, their purpose is to enjoy the special exhibit not to take advantage of the man’s free ride. So I think the man should rent a car. (144 words)The man is supposed to drive everyone in the club to see an exhibition and he borrowed his mom’s van. But the problem is that the van broke down and can’t be repaired in time. There are two possible solutions to this problem. First, he can rent a van. But he thinks it’s a little risky. Because only a few people in the club agree to contribute some money to the van, it’s possible that the man will have to pay most of the bill. The second solution is to postpone the trip until his mom’s van is in good condition. But the man says everyone will be disappointed if they find out that they can’t go to the exhibition when they are ready. Personally, I would recommend the man to rent a van. Since some of the students have already promised to split the rent, those who haven’t replied will definitely agree to contribute money to the van. Even if the man has to pay most of the bill, he has to pay because he is the president and he has the responsibility to complete his task.</li>

<li>The man’s having a trouble with his living arrangements because his roommate is moving off campus. Accordingly, there are two solutions for his problem: firstly, he could wait for the university to assign someone to take his roommate’s place. And second, he could move out and share a house off campus with his roommate. I think the man should move to his roommate for two reasons. Firstly, it’ll be more economical to rent a house with his roommates and some other friends. I guess it’ll be even cheaper than staying in the dormitory. Besides, they could buy a second-hand car to ride together to the campus and share the gas fee, which will balance their life expense too. Last but not least, the man gets along with his roommate, and they could help each other with studying without wasting time on getting used to each other’s living habits or trivial things like that. So I strongly recommend the second solution. (160 words)The man is worrying about his housing next semester, because his great roommate is moving off campus. In the conversation, they talk about two possible solutions. The first one is waiting the university to assign a new roommate to him. But the man thinks the new roommate may have a different study habit. Like, the man is used to studying late at night. What if the new roommate likes to go to bed early? Then this will throw off the man’s study schedule. The second solution is to live in a house off campus with other students. But the thing is the house is very far away from the campus. The man has to get up much earlier to get to campus on time. In my opinion, the man had better choose the first solution, to let university assign a new roommate for him. Chances are that the new roommate also likes to study late at night. The man shouldn’t assume that the new roommate will have a completely different habit. Besides, living on campus is a lot more convenient than living off campus.</li>

<li>Well the woman’s problem is that she is supposed to wear the white shirt to stay the same with her choir members, however she could not wear her only white shirt because of a huge stain on it, and there is no time for her to buy a new one. Accordingly there are two solutions: first, the woman tries to replace her shirt by a similar colored one, and second, the man suggests she borrow one from her roommate. Well, I guess her roommate for help would be a better option, simply because what a choir needs for concert is not only perfect performance of their instruments but also perfect costumes, and obviously a similar colored shirt will ruin all that visual perfection. Second, since white shirts are common and simple outfits for students, and her roommate wouldn’t mind, the woman really has nothing to concern about. After all she is in an emergency, which is quite understandable as well. In a nut shell, I believe the woman should ask her roommate for help. (166 words)The woman is in a choir and the choir is going to have a concert in a hour. All the choir members are required to wear white shirts and black pants. But the woman spilled the spaghetti all over her white shirt and she doesn’t have time to buy another new one. There are two possible solutions. The first one is to wear another shirt that’s not exactly white. It’s a little cream color. But she won’t be looking exactly same as others and some audience may be able to tell the difference. The second solution is to borrow a shirt from her roommate. But her roommate is out of town. And the woman hates to take things without asking. Personally, I would recommend the woman to borrow the white shirt from her roommate. The woman can send a text message or voice message to her roommate to inform her. Since the concert is going to start in an hour, I think the woman’s roommate will understand her action in this emergence.</li>

<li>Well, the man’s problem is that he needs to read a book for the class discussion but he could get a copy. Accordingly thereYe two solutions for the man: he could place a rush order online or he could share the woman’s copy. I think the man should share the woman’s copy simply because the double-priced rush order is way too expensive. Besides, to share reading always means sharing thoughts and sometimes inspirations come out. By careful schedule and regular meetings, the man and the woman could have enough time to discuss and share ideas and insights together, which will be perfect preparation for their discussion in class. In a nut shell, I prefer the second solution for the man. (122 words)None of the bookstores in the campus area has the book the man wants and it’ll take about two weeks to have the book in stock. But the class will be discussing the book next Tuesday. The first solution is to buy the book on the Internet and use rush order delivery. But it’ll cost twice as much money as it takes to buy one in a bookstore. The second solution is to share the woman’s copy until he can get a book from a bookstore. He can read part of the book one day and then the woman can read part of the book another day. But the man worries that he won’t get the book back to her in time. I prefer the second solution. Just like the woman says, as long as the two students keep careful, they won’t delay each other. Furthermore, they only have to share the book for two weeks, since bookstores will have the book in two weeks.</li>

<li>The man’s problem is that he just got the first copy of his research paper back from his professor but he’s got only one day before the deadline of his final draft, so obviously he is running out of time. The woman offers to the man two solutions: he could ask his professor for an deadline extension or he could try his best to make good use of the time left. Well, I suggest that the man should go talking to the professor and ask for a deadline extension, and I have two main reasons. Firstly, it is unfair for the man to have less time preparing for his final draft than any other students, because everyone needs appropriate time to combine suggestions and to review structures and main points, and only in this way their papers can be scored equally. Secondly, no one is at fault and the man doesn’t have to worry that he may be too pushy at all, since the professor might have forgotten the dead line too. So I think asking the professor for the man’s legitimate deadline extension could be a better idea. (189 words)The man just got his first draft of paper from the professor and he has to review all the comments and write a final draft. But there is only one day left. The woman offers him two possible suggestions. The first suggestion is to ask the professor for a deadline extension. Since all the other students got their paper a few days ago and only the man got his paper just now, the professor should take some responsibility for this situation. But the man doesn’t want to seem pushy and offensive. The second possible solution is to do his best with the time left. He can finish the paper quickly and work hard. Since he is a pretty good student, he can get a pretty good grade. But there are too many comments to deal with. If I were the man, I would choose the first solution. Since this is the professor’s fault, even if it’ll be a little uncomfortable asking the extension, it’s still reasonable to do so. There is no need to worry about being offensive. The man just need to tell the problem to the professor in the first place. I’m sure the professor will understand.</li>

<li>Well, the man’s problem is that he finished his paper but forgot to take it with him today. Accordingly, he believes that he could drive home because he lives off campus. The woman suggests that the man talk to the professor and ask for a later copy of his paper by email. Well I guess talking to the professor would be a better solution for the man’s problem for two main reasons. Firstly, the man did get the paper done, and asking for extension wouldn’t be unfair for other students. Considering his attitude it’s quite understandable to be a few hours late. Second, fetching his paper at the cost of being late for most of the class is definitely not worthy. After all, it’s the class that matters to the students not the due date of paper itself. So, I guess talking to the professor about the problem would be a better solution for the man. (157 words)The man wrote his paper last night but he forgot to take it with him. There are two possible solutions. The first one is to drive back to his place and bring the paper back. Since he lives off-campus, if he hurries, he can only come back before the class is over. Still he’ll miss part of the class. The second solution is to talk to the professor and ask her if it’s okay to send the paper later by email. But the professor always starts class on time, the man will only have chance to ask her when the class is over. I would recommend the man to take the first solution. Since the professor is strict with late-submissions and he doesn’t know whether she’ll allow him to submit the paper later by email, it’s better to drive home and bring the paper back even if he’ll miss part of the class.</li>

<li>Scientists have learned that 5 month-old babies can add. Since the evidence is indirect, they devise an experiment to prove this. In the experiment, the researchers first show the baby a doll on the table, and lower a screen to hide the doll, but the baby still knows it is there. Then, they obviously add another doll behind the screen. However, after that they secretly take away one of the dolls. So when they raise the screen back up, there is only one doll there. When the researchers observed the baby’s eye movement that they had recorded during the experiment, they found that the baby stared when it saw only one doll, since babies usually stare at what surprises them. We can conclude the baby is surprised because the baby knew that one plus one equals two, and had expected two dolls when it saw only one. (143 words)In the lecture the professor describes how scientists learn about baby’s mathematical abilities. Researchers did an experiment to test baby’s ability to add–baby knows one plus one equals two. They first put a doll in front of a baby and lowered the screen to hide the doll. So the baby knows it’s there. Then they clearly put another doll behind the screen so there should be two dolls. But researchers secretly took one away and when they lift the screen up, the baby was surprised because it expected to see two dolls but there was only one. We know when a baby is surprised, it stares at the thing that makes it feel surprised. The researchers recorded the baby’s eye-movement with a camera and found that the baby stared. So the baby has the ability to add. It knows one doll plus one doll equals two dolls. </li>

<li>In broad sense, money is whatever one can use to make purchase with, so money comes in different forms. For example, you may pay a five-dollar bill to a taxi driver in exchange for a ride. And the taxi driver then may use the bill to pay a farmer for some vegetables. Anyway, some societies do not use coins and bills as their money, they use something called barter system, under which goods and services are exchanged directly for other goods or services. So the farmer may give the taxi driver some vegetables in exchange for a ride, and in this case the vegetable is a form of money under the system. A narrower definition of money is whatever a government is allowed as legal tender. For example, in the U. S. , people must use coins and bills to pay for their goods and services, like the taxi driver must accept a five-dollar bill as payment rather than some vegetables. (161 words)The professor talks about two definitions of money, a broad one and a narrow one. By the broad definition, money is everything with which we can make purchases. For example, coins and bills can be money, because we can use them to buy goods such as vegetables and pay for services such as taxi. But in a barter system, vegetables can be money, because farmers can give drivers vegetables in exchange for a drive. By the narrow definition, in a society, the legal tender is money. For instance, in the US, drivers and farmers must accept dollars as payment. People can use dollars to pay for taxi and buy vegetables because dollar is the legal tender in the US. So, dollar in the form of coin and bill is money.</li>

<li>There’re two strategies for advertisers to persuade the customers to buy their products. One strategy is repetition. Research shows that when someone is constantly exposed to certain message, he/she will probably believe in it even though it’s actually meaningless or untrue. For example, there’s a car commercial that tries to emphasize the car’s large space. In the commercial, a guy is driving around and keeps picking up different people, and every time he picks up someone, the narrator goes like “plenty of room for friends, plenty of room for families, plenty of room for everybody”. With the repeated message, people who have watched the commercial now believe that the car is roomy even though it’s not. Another strategy is to get a celebrity to advertise a product because people are more likely to accept a claim by someone they admire, like a celebrity. So if a car commercial hires a famous racecar driver as its spokesman, the viewers will be convinced that the car is very fast even though it’s not fast at all. (180 words)The professor talks about two kinds of persuasive strategies in advertising. The first strategy is repetition. When a slogan is repeated enough times, we tend to believe what the slogan says. The example is a car commercial. A guy is driving around and keeps stopping to pick up different people, each time a narrative says “Plenty of room for friends”, “Plenty of room for family” and so on. If we hear the slogan so many times, we tend to believe the car is spacious even if it’s not. The second strategy is using celebrities. We believe celebrities are trustworthy. For example, in a car commercial, if a famous race-car driver is shown in a car and says “I like my car fast”, people will believe the car is fast even if it’s actually not a very fast car.</li>

<li>The artists usually combine or manipulate some visual elements like colors and texture to convey a message or create a mood for an art work. According to the professor, one of this is the use of color. Colors appeal in different ways to the senses and thus can convey/communicate meanings, so artists use different colors to evoke different emotions. For example, red is a strong color, and artists thus use it to evoke strong emotions like anger and excitement, while blue, a cool color, has a calming effect on people. The other is the texture of a painting, an visual illusion created by the artists like roughness or softness. This can also evoke different emotions. Roughness stimulates stronger emotion, while smoothness the other way round. When artists combine these two elements together, they can create a painting that expresses wilder and more chaotic emotions by using red, orange as well as wide sweeping brushstrokes, or they can create a cooler painting with pale colors like blue and soft brush strokes. (170 words)In the lecture, the professor says in order for art to express meaning or emotion, artists need to combine various visual elements such as color and texture. Different colors can evoke different moods. Red is a strong color so it evokes strong emotions such as extreme joy, excitement and anger, whereas blue is a cool color so it evokes calming effect. As for texture, a rough texture can evoke strong emotions and strength, while a smooth texture is more calming and less emotional. Artists need to combine these elements to express meaning or convey message. For example, if a painting uses strong colors such as red and orange and uses brush strokes to give a rough texture, it will convey a wilder and more chaotic emotion in a viewer than a painting with soft colors and smooth texture. </li>

<li>There are two types of motivation that can lead us to behave in certain ways. The first one is extrinsic motivation. That is external reward like money or praise. For example, a child who regularly does housework keeps doing this only because she gets paid by her parents, so the payment is an extrinsic motivation. Once the reward is gone, the child will stop doing it. The second one is intrinsic motivation, that is, people do something because they get a sense of accomplishment or just pleasure, from the activity itself rather than some external rewards. And it lasts longer than extrinsic motivation. For example, the professor keeps going to the gym for 5 years. And she does this not because she actually earns anything from this, like training for marathon, but she feels good about herself  when she does this. So this is an intrinsic motivation and it helps her persist with her work-out for 5_years. (160 words)In the lecture, the professor talks about two types of motivation: extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation. Extrinsic motivation is external. A person with extrinsic motivation performs a behavior in order to get an external reward. For example, a child who does some housework doesn’t really enjoy doing housework. She just wants to obtain some money. If her parents stop giving her money, she might stop doing the housework. However, people with intrinsic motivation do something out of pure pleasure. They do something because they enjoy doing it or they get a sense of accomplishment from it. For example, the professor goes to the gym several times week. She is not going there for Marathon training or anything. She goes there because after some exercise she feels good about herself.</li>

<li>Active attention is voluntary, it occurs when students force themselves to pay attention, so it won’t last for a very long time. For example, you’re teaching in a biology class, and you are describing the frog to students. If you only describe it by lecturing, students will get distracted easily because they are paying active attention that is hard to keep. However, passive attention is involuntary, it happens naturally without any effort, and it lasts longer. If something interesting happens, students begin to pay passive attention even without being aware of it. For example, in the same class, if you describe the frog by showing the students a live frog instead, they will be interested and therefore pay their passive attention. As long as the frog is still there the students will focus on the class. (137 words)Active attention is that we intentionally pay attention to something, so it’s voluntary. Since it requires efforts, it won’t last very long. Passive attention is involuntary and lasts longer than active attention. In the lecture, the professor uses a biology class as an example. Suppose I am the teacher of the class and the topic is about frog. If I walk into the classroom and stand on the podium saying “Frog is kind of animal…” , the students will force themselves to pay attention to my words but this active attention won’t last long. The students will be distracted sooner or later. However, if I take a live frog with me and show it to the students while talking about it, the students will be interested and will involuntarily pay attention to my class. So by taking something unexpected, I make the class engaging and tap into(utilize, take advantage of) the students’ passive attention.</li>

<li>There’re two factors of high quality. The first one is reliability, which refers to the quality that a product works the way consumers expect and doesn’t go wrong very soon. For example, if a car works properly without needing repairs too soon, it’s reliable. People used to care about reliability most, but now as the manufacturing standard becomes higher, the products are all very reliable, so people begin to pay more attention to features. Features are the extras that are not necessary to a product but can make the product cooler and better to use. For example, nowadays cars are loaded with features like electric windows, sunroofs and stereos because these features make cars cooler, also easier to use. (126 words)When a purchaser is considering two identically priced products, they make decisions according to the quality. There are two major factors of product quality: reliability and features. A product is reliable when it works the way we expect. For example, if a car doesn’t work the way it should and it needs repair all the time, it is not reliable. So reliability means the absence of defects and problems. However, our concern with reliability is different now, manufacture standards are so high that products are all very reliable. So reliability is not a deciding factor anymore. Instead, features are becoming more important in making decisions. Features are extras and things aren’t necessary. Features make a product cool and easier to use. For example, in a car, features are electric windows, air conditioning and stereos. Since reliability of different products are almost equal, people care more about the features.</li>

<li>There’re two types of strategies companies use to set initial price for their product. The first one is to set the initial price high in order to create a high-end image for its product and lower it later. Because the products of high price are often assumed to be of high quality, the company can profit from the people who are willing to pay the high price despite the awareness that it’ll come down later. Another strategy is to set the initial price low to undercut competitors, and this strategy is usually adopted in the market that is saturated with the products. For example, a computer company may sell its computers at an affordable price to attract customers who don’t have plans for a computer or to persuade those with one to switch brand. Even with the low price, the company still manages to make profit by encouraging its customers to buy the accessories from the same company. (161 words)The professor talks about two approaches to make initial price of products. One approach is to set the initial price high followed by a lower price later, because companies want to build a high quality image for new products and products with high price are believed to have high quality. Companies can make profits from customers who are willing to pay high price to experience high quality products, especially those innovative high-tech products such as video recorders, video cameras and even cell-phones. Another approach is to set the initial price low to undercut competitors. For example, if a new computer company wants to gain market share, it sells computer in an affordable price. So the company can appeal to customers who wouldn’t be interested to buy computers and those who want to change brand. The company can make profits through selling accessories to its customers.</li>

<li>According to the professor?there’re two ways for plants to protect themselves from insects. The first one is physical defense; some plants like passion plant have physical features that prevent insects from landing on them. The passion plant has little spiky hairs that cover the whole leave. Since the spiky hairs are numerous and dense, the insects can hardly find room to stand on leaves, and therefore cannot eat leaves. Another one is chemical defense, like the one potato plant uses. When attacked by insects, the plant releases a chemical over its leaf system, which discourages the insect from further eating the plant by making the insect feel full, so the insect may think it’s already had enough and stops eating. In this way the potato plant protects itself from insects. (127 words)The professor talks about two different ways plants develop to protect themselves from insects.

For instance, potato plant releases a kind of chemical whenever insects start eating its leaves.

<li>Babies were assumed to react only to themselves, but there’re experiments that show that babies actually have emotion of higher level, that is empathy, which means they can relate and react to the feelings of the others. In the first part of the experiment, the researcher played to the baby some other babies’ cry, and the baby cried when it heard the recording. So at this stage, the researchers assumed that baby cried because of the noise, which was distressing itself. However, they realized later that they were wrong when they did the second part of the experiment, in which they played the tape of the baby’s own cry and surprisingly found that the baby didn’t cry. The second part of the experiment suggests that the baby was probably not upset by the noise of cry as it didn’t cry for his own cry, but that it felt the empathy for the babies whose cry was recorded in the tape. (168 words)The professor talks about an experiment testing babies’ empathy. We all know that if one baby cries in a room, other babies in the same room will cry. Originally, we think it’s because of the noise of the crying, which means baby is directly influenced by the noise rather than feel concern for other babies. But in the experiment, the researchers played a tape recording of a baby’s cry to another baby, then of course the other baby cries. Then the researchers played a tape recording of the baby’s own crying which is equally noisy; however the baby didn’t cry. So baby cried not because of the noise. It could be that the baby felt empathy for the other baby. Then researchers concluded that it’s possible that babies feel empathy, concern, for others.</li>

<li>There’re two principles for balance in interior design, one is unity, another is contrast. Unity means bringing together same elements into a design. For example, you can use green to decorate your house, grassy green for the wall, darker shady green for the sofa and complement with a matching green in the rug. And this will provide you a sense of order and consistence. However, if you have too much unity in a room, it’ll become boring. So you need some contrast to break up that unity, to make your rocxn livelier. For example, you can put bright red cushions on the green sofa, so that the green appears greener next to the red. But you should be careful because too much contrast probably will also destroy the balance by making the room seem busy. (140 words)In the lecture, the professor says an effective design needs to balance unity and contrast.  An easy way to achieve unity is to bring together similar elements. A common practice is by matching colors. For example, we can pick green and use light shade green for the walls, dark shade green for the sofa, and green for the rug. When elements match, the room is unified and gives senses of order and comfort. But too much unity will make a room boring. So we need contrast to break the unity. Contrast serves to disrupt unity in a careful and intentional way. In order to create color contrast, we need to change colors now and then. For example, we could put light red cushion on the dark green sofa. Contrast makes things stand out. Green will look greener next to the red. But too much contrast will make a room feel dizzy and chaotic. So an effective design must avoid too much unity and too much contrast.</li>

<li>Sometimes the demand of a product can be influenced by the price of related product, and there’re two types of those interrelated products. The first is called substitute goods, which means the two products can replace each other. So when the price of one goes up, the demand for the other goes up?too. Take butter and margarine. If the price of butter increases, and is therefore increasingly unaffordable for people, people will begin to buy more margarine, which means the demand for margarine goes up. Another is complement products. That is, either one of the two products can not be used until with the other. For example, compact disc and disc player are complement product, and you cannot use compact disc without a player. The demand for both will decrease if either of them becomes more expensive. For instance, if the price of CD increases, the demand of CD player will go down. (152 words)The demand of a product can be influenced by the price of a related product. The first kind related products are called substitute goods, goods that can be substituted for one and another. They are interchangeable so the increase in the price of one product means the increase in the demand for another. For example, butter and margarine are interchangeable. If the price of butter goes up, people will buy margarine instead. So the increase in the price of butter lead to the increase in demand for margarine. The second kind related products are called complement goods, goods that can’t be used without each other. They complement or complete each other. For example, compact discs and disc player are complement products since they should always be used together. So if the price of either product increases, the demand for both will decrease. If the price of CD goes up, the demand for CD will go down. Since CD player complements CD, the demand for CD player will go down too.</li>

<li>Some sea animals, in order to survive from predators, develop some kinds of camouflage to blend in with their environment. One of them is a kind of fish called leafy sea dragon. It looks like a green dragon with small leaf-like protrusions sticking out from its body like arms. Its color and shape help it to perfectly match with its environment. When it’s swimming among the green sea plants; it looks just like the sea plants, so its predators are not able to detect it. But the camouflage will lose its efficacy if the fish enters a different surrounding without the plants. So there’s another kind of camouflage that is able to change as circumstances change. For example, the cuttlefish has shifting pigment that allows immediate color change if need be, so it can always go with its surroundings to avoid being recognized and eaten by predators wherever it is. (151 words)Some sea animals have developed colors and shapes to resemble environmental features in order to avoid predators. For example, leafy sea dragon has leafy protrusions sticking out like arms. Its shape and color resemble the green sea plants so it blends in well in the environment. When it is swimming through green sea plants, predators have trouble seeing it. But without green plants, its camouflage doesn’t work. Another example is cuttlefish. Unlike leafy sea dragon, Cuttlefish’s camouflage can work anywhere. It changes color to blend in any environment. It has shifting pigments and can change color instantly. If it is swimming by the green sea plants, its color can change to green. If it is swimming by the brown sea floor, its color changes to brown.</li>

<li>Because the deeper part of the ocean is cold and dark, food source there is scarce, so deep sea organisms develop some adaptations to survive. For example, many organisms have physical features that help them to eat preys that are bigger even than them selves, like a kind of eel. The eel has a huge mouth and a large stomach that can expand, so it can eat a large prey that turns into plenty of energy and nutrition to help it sustain for quite a while, before it needs to eat again. Another is the ability to generate light that can be used to capture prey. For example, angler fish has a light-generating structure on its head that is close to its mouth. And when it glows in the dark, other organisms may assume it’s something to eat and are therefore attracted by it. But when they get close enough, the angler fish will catch and eat them. (161 words)The professor uses two examples to illustrate two adaptations that help animals survive in the deepest parts of the ocean. The first example is a kind of eel fish. This eel fish has body features that allow it to eat prey larger than itself. It has an enormous mouth and a stomach that can expand. So when it captures a big prey, it gains a lot food, a lot of nutrition. This allows eel fish to sustain very long before it find another prey. The second example is angler fish. Angler fish has the ability to generate light. It has a little structure on its head which produces light and glows in the dark. The light is close to the fish’s mouth and many other fishes are attracted to this light. So they swim straight toward it and make it easier for angler fish to capture food.</li>

<li>Some birds have eyes that face forwards on the skull, like human eyes. And this kind of eyes allow a bird to clearly see and judge distances with its ability to focus on objects with both eyes and accurately perceive height, width and depth. For example, the hawk has forward eyes on its skull that can allow it to accurately spot its prey, mouse, in the field, even from up in the air. And once it locates the mouse, it swoops down to catch it. Other birds have eyes that are positioned on each side of their skull to help protect themselves from predators. Having eyes on both sides of the skull makes it possible for these birds to watch danger from all directions. For example, a duck eating grasses and insects near the edge of a lake is on constant lookout on both sides for danger from the fox. Once detecting a fox, it can escape. The professor talks about how the position of bird’s eyes help them find food and avoid predators. Some birds have eyes that face forward to the skull so that they can clearly see and judge distance. They can focus on things with both eyes and accurately predict height, width and depth. For example, hawks position their eyes in the front. They have such a good eye sight that they can spot a tiny mouse in a field from high in the sky. When they spot a mouse, they will swoop down and catch it. So the placement of their eyes help them find food. Some other birds have their eyes positioned on each side of the skull in order to avoid predators. Their eyes on both sides help them watch for dangers. For example, when a duck is eating grass and insects, it is constantly looking out for danger from both sides. If a fox is approaching from either side, the duck will fly and escape. So the placement of ducks’ eyes help them avoid predators. </li>

<li>Internal locus of control means the belief that the control comes from oneself rather than external force, and thus the person who has it will attribute their success to their personal effort. For example, if a woman with internal locus of control goes to a job interview, she’ll work very hard to prepare for the interview ahead of time. If she gets the job, she’ll attribute it all to her own effort. But if she doesn’t, she may be upset about herself and try to figure out why she fails and how to improve the next time. However, external locus of control is different. The person with it believes in the decisive role of external forces. For example, a man with external locus of control will attribute his success of a job interview to the interviewer’s good mood and luck rather than his own effort, or blame his failure for bad luck or the interviewers instead of his own problem. And he won’t even try to improve himself for the next time. (183 words)The professor uses two interviewees as examples to explain internal and external locus of control. In the first example, the girl who has internal locus of control believes her success and preparation are her responsibilities. So she worked hard ahead of time. If she succeed, she will think its because of her hard work. If she fails, she will be disappointed and try to figure out how she can improve for the next time. Another example is a man who has external locus of control. He thinks interviewers have more influence on his interview, which means his success depends on luck. So he didn’t work hard to prepare for the interview. He is more likely to take risks, interviewing jobs that he is not qualified for. If he gets it, he thinks it’s because interviewers are having a good day. If he doesn’t get it, he will blame the interviewers and won’t try to figure out how he might have done better. </li>

<li>Diffusion is a cultural process through which a cultural feature, like a custom_or an innovation is spread from one group or society to another when the two cultures come into contact. This process can take place over long distances and over long periods of time. A good example of this is reading modern newspaper in the U. S. The characters in the paper were borrowed from another culture hundreds of years ago; the printing was invented in Germany; then the paper itself was invented in China. However, the process of diffusion does not happen easily; it’s selective. For example, the practice of Chinese acupuncture has been accepted by many people in the U. S. as an effective way of relieving pain and curing disease. But the philosophy behind it was hardly understood and accepted because the idea was too foreign, and people tend to resist the ideas that are too different from their own values and beliefs. (155 words)Diffusion is a culture process whereby one group or society adopts another’s item such as a custom, a type of food or an invention. Take the modern newspaper in the US as an example, the characters on the page came from another culture many centuries ago, the printing of words was invented in Germany and paper in China. These innovations were shared across cultures over a long distance and over a long periods of time. Besides, diffusion is sometimes selective. For example, people in the US accept the practice of acupuncture, but few of them fully understand it. Because cultures tend to resist ideas that are too different from their own beliefs and values. If ideas are close to their own, they will incorporate, absorb and diffuse them. So American culture only accepts the practice of acupuncture but not the philosophy of Chinese medicine.</li>

<li>There’re two major characteristics of target customers that influence marketing strategy for products. The first one is age. For example, a toy car company tends to put their advertisements during children’s TV show so that they’re more likely to be viewed by children and their parents, which are the target customers for the company. If the children see the commercial, they’ll probably ask their parents to buy the toy for them. Another is geographical location, that’s where the target customers live. A boat company will not release ads in cities and towns that are far away from waters, but rather in places near seas or lakes, because people in those places have the need for a boat and the company will be able to maximize its sales. (133 words)The professor talks about two characteristics of target customers that can influence company’s marketing strategy. The first characteristic is age. If a company makes toy cars, its target customers are kids. It should advertise on Television during the time kids watch television. This makes sure that the advertisement reaches the kids so the company can get people in that age group to buy toy cars. The second characteristic is geographical location where the target customers live. If a company wants to sell boats, its target customers must live near ocean and lakes since only people live near water need boats. So the company will advertise in cities and towns that are near ocean and lakes in order to reach its target customers and therefore to sell more boats.</li>

<p><center><strong>Letter in the Centerville College News</strong></center><br>The administration has plans to acquire a new sculpture for campus. We should all oppose this plan. The university’s poor financial condition led it to increase the price for campus housing and tuition by 15% this past year. Surely then it is no financial position to purchase such an expensive sculpture. Moreover, just look at the sculpture: several 60-foot ling steel plates, jutting out of the earth at odd angles! It’s so large, it’ll take up all the green space in front of the campus center! This is public space that should be reserved for students to use.</p>

First of all, the woman believes that the money wouldn’t be a problem and the assumption in the letter is totally wrong, since an anonymous donor is paying the bill for most of the sculptures instead of the university. And she disagrees with the advice made in the letter because she thinks that the lawn taken for the sculptures will only upset Paul alone instead of other students, simply because Paul has to move to other places of the campus for his ball-playing. In a word, the woman disagrees with the letter for the reasons stated above. (116 words)The writer of the letter opposes the university’s plan to acquire a new sculpture because the university’s financial condition is poor and the sculpture is so large that it’ll take up all the green space in front of the campus center. The woman in the conversation thinks the two reasons are totally unconvincing. The woman says it’s an anonymous donor who pays the bill of the sculpture not the university so there is no need to worry about the university’s financial condition. As for the point about the space, the woman thinks Paul, the writer of the letter, always plays soccer with his friends on the lawn where the sculpture will be. She thinks Paul just doesn’t want to move to another place. For him, it’s convenience versus sculpture.</li>

Instead, students will be offered a wide assortment of cold breakfast items in the morning. These cold breakfast foods, such as breads, fruit, and yogurt, are healthier than many of the hot breakfast items that we will stop serving, so health-conscious students should welcome this change.

<li>Well, the woman disagrees with the announcement for two main reasons. For one thing she believes that students will need hot food from time to time. For example on cold mornings students will need hot food like hot cereal more than cold food like yogurt. Secondly she argues that the students will go off-campus to pay more prices to get what they want due to the cutting back of meals. As a result the cost will actually add up and is therefore a worse situation for the students. All in all, the woman disagrees with the announcement for the reasons stated above. (103 words)Dining services will not serve hot breakfast food anymore. They only serve cold breakfast food. The woman in the conversation thinks the change is ridiculous. First of all, she thinks whether something is hot or cold doesn’t necessarily mean it is healthy. She says that in a really cold morning, a nice warm omelet is obviously better than a bowel of cold cereal. Secondly, she thinks the change will not help save money. Because if the students can’t get what they want from dining hall, they will go off-campus. Then they have to pay off-campus price, which is more expensive. So this change will not help save money but actually end up costing more.</li>

<p><center><strong>Evening Computer Classes May Be Added</strong></center><br>The computer department is considering offering evening classes in the fall. The proposal to add the classes is a response to student complaints that daytime computer classes have become increasingly overcrowded and there are no longer enough computers available. The department has decided that despite some added expense, the most cost-effective way of addressing this problem is by adding computer classes in the evening. It is hoped that this change will decrease the number of students enrolled in day classes and thus guarantee individual access to computers for all students in computer classes.</p>

<li>Well, the man is strongly against the changing plan for two main reasons. First, he insists that most of the students are busy at night with such as jobs, families, clubs and so on, so they won’t be able to make good use of the added class anyway. Second, he believes that the idea of hiring more teachers to keep the academic building open later at night would be a bad idea. Since the computer prices have been reduced, it’s surely cheaper to invest in more computers. More importantly there is enough space in the building for holding more computers. So the man disagrees with the plan for the reasons stated above. (110 words)The Computer Department proposes to add evening computer classes because daytime computer classes have become overcrowded. But the man in the conversation thinks it’s a bad proposal. The man says that most of the students have already got their own plans in the evenings. They have jobs, family, clubs and social events so they won’t have time to attend the evening classes. The man also says that it’s actually going to cost more to open evening classes than to simply buy more computers, since to open new classes need to hire new teachers. However, computer is not expensive now. Plus, the computer classrooms are big enough to hold more computers. So he thinks buying more computers is a better way to solve the problem.</li>

<li>The man agrees with the university’s plan for two main reasons. First of all, he thinks it’s a very good practice for the culinary art students. For them cooking in class is a lot easier than cooking for classmates in the dining hall, because while cooking in class they can take their time, but cooking in the dining hall is quite a different atmosphere, a more stressful one. The second reason from the man is that the culinary art students would make fantastic meals which are gonna be cheaper, and thus the students could save more money not dinning out in some of the expensive restaurants. (101 words)The man thinks it’s a great idea to let the culinary students to cook meals in the Campus Dining Club. His first reason is that it’s good for students in the culinary program. His cousin is in the program and says preparing meals for a large number of people is very different from just cooking in the classes. Because cooking in classes, you can just take time, but cooking for many people, you have a lot of pressure and might make mistakes. So it’s a very a good practice for them. His second reason is that even with the extra cost, the meals provided by these students are still much cheaper than that of the fancy restaurants in the town. But the food will be equally good. He thinks it’ll be worth it.</li>

<p><center><strong>History Seminars Should Be Shorter</strong></center><br>Currently, all of the seminar classes in the history department are three hours long. I would like to propose that history seminars be shortened to two hours. I make this proposal for two reasons. First, most students just cannot concentrate for three hours straight. I myself have taken these three-hour seminars and found them tiring and sometimes boring. Also, when a seminar lasts that long, people stop concentrating and stop learning, so the third hour of a three-hour seminar is a waste of everyone’s time. Two-hour seminars would be much more efficient.</p>

<li>Well, the woman strongly disagrees with the proposal for two main reasons. Firstly, she believes that the problem of concentration is not typically shared by most of the students who just have regular routines of study and rests. Instead, the problem only lies in Tim’s individual habits due to his partying late at night. Secondly, the woman feels that the last hour of seminar is the most worthwhile part of everything, for the reason that students usually get involved in the discussion and start exchanging important ideas. So based on all that reasons, the woman is strongly against the proposal. (103 words)Tim proposes to shorten the seminar to two hours because most students can’t concentrate for three hours straight and students stop learning at the third hour. The woman in the conversation totally disagrees with the proposal. She says Tim is not a typical student. He stays up late every night and that’s why he can’t concentrate in the seminar. But most students aren’t like him. They all come to seminars with good rests and preparation. Also, Tim always sleeps in the classes. He doesn’t know that the third hour of a seminar is the most important part because that’s when students begin discussions and start to exchange ideas. So the last hour is the most worthwhile part of a seminar and shouldn’t be canceled.</li>

<li>Well, the woman totally disagrees with the university’s plan for several reasons. First of all, she believes that the students have got so many requirements that they wont have enough time to take the classes mentioned in the plan, not for the reason that art major students don’t want to enroll in these classes. And she adds that the art major students need more options for their own personal interests. Secondly, she thinks that the plan is drastic because money is not the problem. The university could hire a part-time professor or try asking the current professors who teach painting to work in their secondary fields. For example she argues that a few painting teachers could as well be excellent sculptors. In a word, the woman disagrees with the plan for the reasons stated above. (134 words)The university is planning to discontinue the sculpture course because students lack interest in it and the department’s only professor is retiring. The woman in the conversation thinks the university has got it all wrong. The low enrollment in the sculpture course is not due to students’ lack of interest but to students’ lack of time. Sculpture course is optional. The required courses such as painting and drawing take much of the students’ time. Besides, the woman thinks the university can hire a part-time teacher to teach sculpture course. There are many professors who have secondary fields. For instance, many painting teachers are also good sculptors. The woman is sure that these professors can teach the sculpture course.</li>

<li>Well according to the proposal, the student’s suggesting that the university should display the students’ paintings and other artworks at the entrance to the students’ center. However the woman disagrees with that proposal for two main reasons. First of all, she thinks the entrance of the students’ center is crowded with people coming and going, which will block the views of the displays and is very distracting. Secondly, she believes that the displays need controlled lights like art museum to keep the light always at the same level instead of the natural light from windows which is changing all the time, either too bright or too dark. So based on the reasons given above the woman disagrees with the proposal. (126 words)In the letter, the student proposes to put the artworks in the lobby at the entrance to the student center, because the center has many students and is full of natural light. But the girl in the conversation doesn’t agree with it. For the first point about many students passing through student center, she thinks the number of students coming and going is huge, which could be distracting for people to view the artworks. The center is always crowded with people. It’s hard to appreciate the artworks with so many people around.  For the second point about natural light, she thinks it’s not very good. If it’s a sunny day, it’ll be way too bright. If it’s a cloudy day, it’ll be way too dark. Instead, the artworks need consistent light like the electric light in an art museum because the electric light is always carefully controlled and stays at a same level.</li>

<li>Well, the woman disagrees with the plan for two main reasons. In the first place, she believes that such amount of money could be wisely spent in some other places in order to attract more top students. For example, she says, the university could use the funds to update the outdated equipment in the lab, get more books for the library and try to enlarge the students’ center, which she thinks will virtually attract more top students. Secondly, she also holds the point that people from the town didn t come to the game of the university just because the teams of the university are too lose, not because of the places of the game, which means just building a stadium would not do much help, since people won’t change their impressions overnight. So based on the reasons stated above the woman disagrees with the plan of the university. (147 words)The university is planning to build a new athletic stadium in order to attract more top students and to strengthen its relationship with the town. The woman doesn’t think it’ll work. Firstly, the woman thinks some of the conditions on campus are too bad to attract top students. For example, science labs have outdated equipment, library not enough books and student center being too small. Secondly, the woman says that since our teams always lose, people in the town rarely come to watch the games. And it’s impossible that the teams improve overnight. Besides, adding seats won’t help either. People in the town won’t come to stadium just because it is bigger. So building this new stadium is not going to improve the relationship with the town. </li>

<p><center><strong>University Should Allow Eating in Class</strong></center><br>Currently, there is a university-wide policy that prohibits eating in the classroom. I disagree with this policy. I think students should be allowed to eat in class. This change would be good for two reasons. For one thing, if students were permitted to eat, they would be able to concentrate better, because students often get hungry during long classes, and hunger makes it difficult to concentrate. Also, if food were allowed in classrooms, it would be possible for us to have in-class parties on the last day of class-with snack foods and beverages-to celebrate the end of each semester.<br>Sincerely,<br>Nancy Myers</p>

<li>Well, the proposal says that the students should be allowed to eat in their classrooms for two reasons: first eating in the classroom will help students concentrate, and second people could take food to the classroom for a party on the last day of class. However the man disagrees with the proposal for two main reasons. For one thing, he holds the opinion that eating in the classroom will be so distracting that students just won’t get concentrated at all while listening to the munching, biting, or crinkling around. He thinks eating in the classroom is indeed bothering for the students who needs concentration. Also, he argues that students won’t have time for the in-class party since the last class is usually important and they couldn’t afford to waste time parting instead of getting ready for the finals. So the man disagrees with the proposal. (145 words)The writer proposes that university should allow students to eat in the classroom so that students can concentrate better and can have in-class parties on the last day of class. The man doesn’t think the proposal is a good idea. For its first reason that students can concentrate better, the man says it indeed helps the person who eats snacks to concentrate but others will be disturbed and interfered by the eating noise. So other students can’t pay attention with all the eating noise around. For its second reason, the man says it’s not appropriate to have parties in the last class, because the last class is very important. Students do reviews for the final exam. If they spend time doing other things, they won’t be well-prepared.</li>

<p><center><strong>University Should Pave Running Trails</strong></center><br>The university has about three miles of unpaved dirt running trails that pass through the forest near campus. I think these trails should be paved with cement. One reason for paving the trails would be to increase their safety. When it rains, the dirt turns to mud and becomes very slippery, so the runners who use them can slip and fall. Pavement would solve this problem. Also, paving would make the trails look nicer, which would encourage students to use them. Bumps in the trail would be smoothed out and weeds would be paved over, making the trail more attractive to runners.<br>Sincerely<br>Sally Jacobs</p>

<li>Well, the proposal says that the university should pave the dirt trail with cement for two reasons. However the man doesn’t agree wrth the proposal for some reasons. First of all, he argues that it’s safer for people to run repeatedly on a trail with soft surface than on a paved one, simply because it’ll do less damage and injuries to human bodies. Besides, he is against the proposal’s second opinion mainly because students will take a break for walking on the trail, since it’s more natural and students would have a chance to relax. So based on the reasons above the man disagrees with the proposal. (106 words)The writer of the letter proposes that university should pave running trails to increase their safety and also make them look nicer. The man in the conversation thinks the proposal is a terrible idea. As for the thing about making trails safer, the man says the writer doesn’t think about the long-term consequences of running on a hard surface. It’s too hard on bones and joints and can lead to injuries. So it’s actually safer to run on the soft surface. About making trails look nicer, the man doesn’t think people will like it. He says the main reason why people enjoy the trails now is that people can take a break from buildings and streets to feel the nature. If the university paves the trails, the trails will look similar to buildings and streets. Then people won’t go there anymore.</li>

<li>Well, the man disagrees with the suggestions in the letter for two major reasons. First of all, he thinks that hiring more doctors won’t solve the problem simply because the health center is tiny and therefore wouldn’t support more doctors or patients. So he believes that there should be more room before hiring more doctors. Secondly, he says that opening the health center on weekends wouldn’t fix the problem either, since students are generally away on weekends—there won’t be many students there. Opening the health center on weekends makes no point at all. So the man disagrees with the suggestions in the letter. (104 words)The writer suggests that health center hire more doctors so that each patient receives quality treatment and that health center open on weekends in order to treat people who get sick over the weekend. The man in the conversation doesn’t think the two suggestions will do much good. As for the first suggestion, the man says the health center is tiny. It suffers lack of space. Unless it builds more treat room or offices, problems can’t be solved. About the second suggestion, the man says most students aren’t here on weekend. There are just not a lot of people here. Most of them are in town. Plus, students leave more often on weekend. All these mean that there is not much demand for treatment on weekends. </li>

<p><center><strong>New Library Workspaces</strong></center><br>Say good-bye to the big, multiperson study tables in Turner Library. This summer, the tables will be exchanged for new personal study cubicles-small, one-person desks enclosed by walls. These new units will allow students to have privacy and work in isolation and will therefore eliminate noise in the library so students can concentrate. Additionally, the cubicles will enable the library to accommodate the recent increase in the number of students attending our university. Although the current tables seat six students each, they make poor use of the available floor space. The cubicles, on the other hand, are designed for maximum space efficiency, and the library can therefore add 50 new seats.</p>

<li>The man disagrees with the upcoming change for two main reasons.

Besides, he thinks that there is no such problem as overcrowding. He says there are empty tables all the time in the library even when the university enrolls in more students, and therefore replacing the tables would be a waste of money, since there is quite sufficient room for the students who use the library.

He thinks instead of changing tables, the university should build meeting rooms to reduce the noise in the main library hall. As for the second purpose to accommodate more students, the man says the library has no problem with overcrowding. He sees empty tables all the time and the woman always takes a whole table for herself.

<li>According to the article, the university choir will add competitive events at other locations to its schedule, and the man agrees with the change for two main reasons. First of all, he believes that such a change will motivate the students because some other schools are good, and the students in the choir will have to work hard to go up against them. He believes that the students will even work harder; they’d perhaps rehearse more often singing the line. The second reason for the man’s preference is that even though the program is small, there are talented people in the program and if students go to off-campus events and win the public attention, their performance could attract more people to both the university and the musical program. So the man is looking forward to the change for the reasons stated above. (144 words)The university choir decides to enter off-campus singing competition in order to better its performance and help the music program grow. The man in the conversation likes this plan. Firstly, he thinks this change will motivate the singers in the choir. Since other schools’ choirs are very good, the university choir has to work harder to compete against them. So the university choir may practice more often than did it before and thus better the performance. Secondly, he says if the choir goes to those off-campus events, there will be many students listening to them and if the students feel good, they may choose to come to the university and join the program. Therefore, the music program will grow.</li>

<li>Group think is a process by which groups may make bad or irrational decisions as its members try to conform to the assumed group consensus. And the professor takes his own experience in a computer company a couple of years ago. One day he and his co-worker proposed to change the design of their computer to attract more customers. This suggestion was first supported by most of the group while rejected by a few senior managers who thought the move was unnecessary. But then many of the group, including his co-worker, began to change their mind because they didn’t want to ruin their chances of promotion by disagreeing with the senior managers. So finally there was only the professor who held up the vote, and he began to doubt whether his insistence was worthwhile. As all people sided with the senior managers, he gave up this idea and the whole group decided to stay with the current design. However, this decision cost them a lot of money as their competitors adopted a new design on the same year which won over their customers. (182 words)</li>

<li>Audience effects suggest that with the knowledge that they’re being watched while working, people usually alter their behavior during their work. And the professor illustrates the principle with two studies that suggest this. In the first study, two groups of students were asked to put on shoes that they had to tie, one group being told later that they would be observed, while the other group being kept in dark. So when the researchers began to observe, they found that the group aware of the observation tied faster than the other group. This study shows how audience effects speed up people’s action. While the second study suggests that when people are learning new things, with the awareness of being observed, they will not only accelerate, but also increase certain behavior pattern. For instance, when they learn to type, they’ll type faster, but meanwhile make more mistakes. (141 words)The principle of audience effects is that individuals’ performance is affected by the knowledge that others are watching them. The professor uses examples of tying shoes and learning to type to demonstrate that we actually increase our speed of performing if we know that we are being observed. In the example of tying shoes, one group of college students was told that they were being observed, the other didn’t know they were being observed. The students who knew they were being watched tied their shoes much faster than the other group. And in the example of learning to type, when we are conscious of being observed, we will increase typing speed. We type faster than we do alone. Also, other behavioral pattern will increase, like making mistakes. So when we type faster when we know we are being observed, we also make more mistakes.</li>

For example, a cellphone company may show a cellphone commercial emphasizing its variety of colors and entertainment functions during entertainment programs for young people like pop concerts or the like, since the audience then are usually teenagers, and they’re very likely to be fascinated and ask their parents to buy the fun phone for them. However, the company may also create a different commercial that shows how convenient and productively helpful the phone is and put it during the business news hour to attract business people. According to the two examples, the cellphone company can maximize the sales of its cellphones with the help of target marketing.

Also, in the commercial, kids are having a good time with their friends. If the company wants to appeal to businessmen, it’ll put a different TV commercial in a business program. Besides, the commercial will show how the cell-phone can handle all business efficiently and can save money. So it’s basically the same cell-phone, but the company makes two different commercials to attract two specific groups of people.</li>

<p><center><strong>Explicit Memories and Implicit Memories</strong></center><br>In everyday life, when people speak of memory, they are almost always speaking about what psychologists would call explicit memories. An explicit memory is a conscious or intentional recollection, usually of facts, names, events, or other things that a person can state or declare. There is another kind of memory that is not conscious. Memories of this kind are called implicit memories. An individual can have an experience that he or she cannot consciously recall yet still display reactions that indicate the experience has been somehow recorded in his or her brain.</p>

<li>Implicit memories are unconscious memories of events and stuffs that are recorded in our mind. And the professor uses the car advertisement as an example. On the highway, there was a billboard that advertised a car. On the billboard was the picture of the car, and above the board was its name Panther in huge letters. Many people drove by the billboard and saw it. However, when the researchers asked the drivers if they saw any car ad on the road, they couldn’t remember it. Then, the researchers asked these people to name an animal starting with the letter “p”?and surprisingly, they all said panther instead of “pig”?which is the most common animal starting with the letter “p” . This research suggests that even though implicit memories can’t be aware of, it’s there and still affects people. (139 words)Explicit memories are conscious recollections whereas implicit memories are not conscious. But implicit memories still have effects on us. The professor in the lecture uses an example of billboard to explain implicit memory. There are many billboards along the highway and when drivers drive through, they see those billboards. They don’t remember all the billboards but the billboards affect them. Suppose there is a car advertisement with its name panther above its picture. A lot of drivers passed it by. Later, when asked whether they remember seeing any car advertisements, the drivers will say no because they honestly don’t remember. They don’t have conscious memory of the panther billboard. But if asked to name an animal starting with a letter “P”, drivers will say “panther”. So the car billboard had effect on them.</li>

<li>Individuals often modify their behavior based on the possible consequence they’ve learned of their behavior. This phenomenon is called behavioral modification. For example, kids who just start school will generally misbehave, like interrupting the teachers or walking around in the classroom when they should sit down. When they do this, the teacher gets angry and punishes them by not allowing them to go out and play when everyone else is playing. And they learn the unpleasant consequence of their misbehavior so they will stop doing this. However, when the kids behave properly, like raising their hands to answer questions and sitting quietly while paving attention in class, the teacher encourages them by putting a smiling face on their book. This is a positive feedback and the kid will be more likely to repeat the approved behavior. (136 words)Behavior modification is a phenomenon that individuals change their behaviors based on what they have learned about the consequences of certain behaviors. The professor uses an example to illustrate the phenomenon. In the example, at the beginning, the kids at school don’t know the rules of class. They may interrupt the teacher, walk around the classroom. The teacher gets angry with them, so the kids get published. They have to sit in the classroom when everyone else is playing outside. They don’t like this consequence. They know these behaviors get them in trouble. So they start to raise hand, sit quietly, and pay attention to the teacher. They get reward from doing so. The teacher may say that she is proud of them and maybe put happy face stickers on their homework. Now that their behaviors get good reactions from teacher, the kids learn to always act like this.</li>

<p><center><strong>Revealing Coloration</strong></center><br>Many animals use coloration to protect themselves from predators. One defensive strategy involving the use of coloration is what is known as revealing coloration. Animals employing this strategy have an area of bright color on some part of their body; this bright color is usually hidden from predators’ view. When approached by a predator, the animal suddenly reveals the area of bright color; this unexpected display of color startles or confuses the predator and provides the would-be prey with an opportunity to escape.</p>

The second one is morpho butterfly, which has special wings whose shiny parts are usually hidden when it’s resting. But if a bird approaches, the morpho flies away.

All of these told him that the story took place in the 1940s in a big city. Then he noticed that the city was gloomy, because there wasn’t much light, only a bit light from the street lamp. Besides, it rained and fogged. So the whole scene seemed dark, gloomy and mysterious. When the action started and the detectives began to talk, he already knew that the story took place in a tall building, in a 1940s big city, and the story was dark and mysterious because of what he saw in the establishing shot.

And they usually played together, pretending to be action heros . So when the toy that featured action heros came out, they all wanted it, and it was already popular from the onset.

<li>Outsider art is used to describe art works made by people who choose to live and work outside the society. These works are usually very unique because the artists are barely trained. For example, Henry Dodger was an artist who lived far away from people in Chicago in the 1900s, and he had never received any formal artistic education, so his work was very unique. What’s more, he didn’t have any friends and kept his work private during his lifetime. In one of his water painting that describes the adventure of seven children, he had difficulty drawing figures, so he solved the problem by cutting off figures from newspapers and magazines and pasted them on the illustration of trees, flowers and grass that he painted. As a result, his painting often looks a little strange?more cluttered because its entire surface is painted. And it’s also longer than any other works, about nine feet long. That’s why Henry Dodger is considered as an outsider artist.

It wasn’t easy for him to become a journalist at first, but when he adapted himself to the job, he realized that he was actually good at it, and therefore a job reporter became his comfort zone.

The professor illustrates this with a monkey experimgnt that he read about. In the experiment, a researcher was given two groups of monkey and asked to teach them to pick up a ball and put it in a box. And he had been told that one group was smarter than the other, which was not true. Therefore, anyway, the researcher expected that the smarter group was easier to train. And it took two hours less time to train the supposedly smarter monkey because he tried to communicate with them, frequently smiled at them, encouraged them, and talked to them. While with the other group, he was not that enthusiastic. So actually it’s the researcher’s behavior that influenced the result. That’s how experimenter effect is achieved during the experiment. (152 words)Experimenter Effect is a problem that occurs when a researcher’s expectations affect the outcome of the experiment.  In the example, the researcher was given two groups of monkeys. He was asked to train them to pick up a ball and put it in a box. Then he recorded how many hours it took to train each group of monkeys to learn to do so. Before experiment, the researcher was told that one group is more intelligent than the other. But actually they are all the same. What’s surprising is that it took the researcher two-hour less time to train the supposedly more intelligent group than the supposedly less intelligent group. This is because the researcher thought one group is smarter and would be easier to train so he smiled to them, gave them encouragement and communicated with them a lot. However, the researcher wasn’t very enthusiastic about the other group, the supposedly less intelligent group. So the researcher’s expectation actually influenced the result of the research.</li>

<p><center><strong>Social Loafing</strong></center><br>When people work in groups to perform a task, individual group members may feel less motivated to contribute, since no one person is held directly responsible for completing the task. The result is that people may not work as hard, or accomplish as much, as they would if they were working alone and their individual output were being measured. This decrease in personal effort, especially on a simple group task, is known as social loafing. While it is not a deliberate behavior, the consequence of social loafing is less personal efficiency when working in groups than when working on one’s own</p>

<li>The phenomenon that an individual tends to decrease his/her effort in a task conducted by a group is called social loafing. According to the professor, a study was done to illustrate the phenomenon. In the study, some people were asked to peel as many  potatoes as possible within a given amount of time. Some of them worked alone, and they were told that the number of potatoes that each of them had peeled would be recorded. Others worked in a group and were told that only the total number of potatoes would be recorded, and there was no counting of how many each individual had peeled. When the results were compared, the researcher discovered that the individuals in a group peeled much less potatoes than those working alone. So this study suggests that when in a group, people are likely to contribute less since they don’t think they’re directly responsible for the task. (155 words)Social loafing happens when individuals in a group perform less well than they do on their own, which leads to less personal efficiency. The professor uses a study to illustrate this phenomenon. In the study, people were asked to peel potatoes, to peel as many potatoes as possible at a given amount of time. Some chose to work alone and were told that the number of potatoes each peeled will be record. Others chose to work in a group and they were told that only the total number of potatoes peeled would be recorded. So it was impossible to tell how many one person had done. Then the researchers compared the average number of potatoes peeled alone and that peeled together. They found out that people who worked as a group peeled significantly fewer potatoes than those who worked alone.</li>

<p><center><strong>Ritualization</strong></center><br>Sociobiologists believe that some communicative behavior in animals is developed through a process called ritualization. In this process, the purpose of a given behavior changes over time-a behavior that originally had a practical purpose develops into one that communicates a specific message. For example, a certain movement or physical feature might evolve to serve as a signal or a warning that other animals will understand. Once a behavior is ritualized, it becomes a form of communication; therefore, if an animal engages in this behavior, other animals will be able to interpret the meaning of the behavior quickly and respond appropriately.</p>

<li>The lecture mainly talks about ritualization, a process by which a practical behavior in animals develops into a communicative one. The professor uses the example of dogs showing their teeth to explain it. Originally, dogs showed their teeth before they were going to bite to avoid biting their own lips. Then other animals learned that dogs always showed their teeth before they bit, so they began to read it as a warning signal and they would stay away the dogs after they saw this. As this happened again and again, the dog realized that it didn’t have to bite to protect itself, and showing teeth is enough to keep other animals away, so they began to use it as a warning signal. This is how the dog showing its teeth has been ritualized. (132 words)Ritualization is a process in which an animal’s behavior that originally serves a practical purpose develops into one that communicates a specific message. The professor use dog’s baring teeth as an example to explain the concept. If dogs feel threatened, they show their teeth, meaning stay away. Before this dog’s behavior become a recognizable warning, its original purpose is to avoid biting its own lips. When dogs sense danger, they bite and instinctively bare teeth to avoid biting their own lips. But other animals over time notice the teeth baring behavior always came before a dog’s going to bite. So they started to read it as a signal to be careful. After this scenario repeated time after time, dogs themselves start to be aware that simply baring teeth is enough to protect themselves. So they use this behavior as a warning signal to communicate the possibility to attack rather than actually attack.</li>

However, sometimes an animal species may display a behavior that no longer serves a clear purpose. The original purpose for the behavior may have disappeared long ago, even thousands of years before. These behaviors, known as relict behaviors, were useful to the animal when the species’ habitat was different: but now, because of changed conditions, the behavior no longer serves its original purpose.

<li>Relict behavior refers to a kind of behavior in animals that was critical to their survival a long time ago but serve no purpose now due to the change of the environment. In the lecture, the professor takes the American pronghorn that lives in North America. It’s known as the fastest animal in the western hemisphere, and none of its present predators, like bobcat or coyote, can catch up with it. However, the pronghorn was fast for a reason a long time ago. Tens of thousands of years ago, there were lions on the grassland, and lions preyed on pronghorns. Since lions were very fast, the pronghorns, in order to survive, had to run for their life. That was how the pronghorn gained its speed. However, lions were extinct then, so the primary reason for the pronghorn’s speed was gone. But the behavior remained, and became what’s known as relict behavior. (153 words)Relict behavior no longer serves its original purpose because of changed conditions. It might be useful to the animal when habitat was different. Pronghorn lives on open grassy plains. It is superfast, actually the fastest animal in the western hemisphere. Whenever its predators appear, it’s off in a flash. The reason why it runs so fast is that long time along, the grassy plain was different. Lions used to live there and chased pronghorns. Lions were much faster than bobcat, so pronghorn’s speed was critical to its survival. But now lions are extinct. They are no longer the predators. Because of this condition change, pronghorn’s speed doesn’t serve its original purpose and thus becomes a relict behavior.</li>

<li>Recently, I read a book named Keep the aspidistra flying written by George Orwell. The book influences me a lot because the story has something that touches my heart. The story talks about a man who wants to be a poet and who abandons many well-paying jobs to pursue his dream of being a poet. I have a similar experience of quitting a very good job in order to be a writer. Also, the man in the story is lack of money because he works as a bookstore assistant and thus has a very low salary. He lives in a shabby apartment and sometimes have no money to buy food. Again, I’ve got similar experience. I once lived in a cramped apartment alone and had no money. The book is important to me because it touches me and gives me encouragement to persist.</li>
<li>The book that was important to me was an instruction manual on how to pronounce English.When I was a middle school student, I did not speak English very well. I always confused the Chinese pronunciation with the English pronunciation, and I was frustrated with that. So I used this book to practice a lot. And there was also a video with this book, so I watched the video, I practiced and imitated the pronunciation.Now I have improved my English and also gained some confidence because of the book.</li>

<li>I often go to the basketball court near my apartment. It’s very important to me because I play basketball there everyday and basketball is my favorite sport. Ever since I was a little boy, I have been playing in that court with my friends. When in junior high, I practiced shooting and dribbling in that court nearly everyday till late at night. Besides, the court is the reminder of an awful lot of my valuable memories. I still can remember that how I started out shooting badly and then after several weeks’ practice, I could shoot well and dribbled well. I can also remember many friends with whom I played basketball and form teams. Without that court, I couldn’t possibly make so many friends. So it’s very important to me.</li>

<li>I think a good parent should be patient. Because children are always confused with the things around them, they ask questions every now and then. A good parent should be patient enough to give them answers. When i was very young, I always asked questions like “Why can airplanes fly?”,“Why can’t we fly?” and “Why the earth is a globe?”. My parents answered these questions patiently and if they couldn’t, they would buy books that have the answers to my questions. I also think a good parent should be open-minded. In other words, they should respect their children’s decisions when their kids are growing up. My parents always show their respect to my decisions. My major in the college is software engineering, but I decided to be an English teacher after graduation. My parents respected my decision and allow me to pursue my own interest. Thanks to my parents, I am patient and I respect other people.</li>

<li>I miss food most when I am away from my home, particularly the noodles cooked by my father. When I was in high school, my father always cooked noodles for me at night. Every day after evening self-study classes, I came home and had the noodles. The noodles were delicious, coz you know, after long-time study, it’s easy to be tired and hungry. So the first thing I did when I got home at that time was to eat noodles. Sometimes, my father would add beef to the noodles and beef is kind of my favorite meat. The most important ingredient of the noodles is the specially-made sauce. Sadly, I don’t know how exactly my father makes the sauce. But whenever I go back home, I need to have the noodles cooked by my father.</li>

<li>When I was a child, I enjoyed going to an Internet Bar. It is still open now. It’s only 5-minute’s walk away from my home and sits beside the street. The internet bar is not very big. It only has two rooms and each is full of computers. In summer vacations, My friends and I usuallywent there early in the morning playing many computer games such as Age of Empire, Star War and Counter Strike. The owner of the bar is a very kind person. He opened the door very early in the morning just for us. My friends and I occupied a room, sit side by side and yelled to each other when we were playing games. It was a lot of fun.</li>

It’s very hard to unite all the family members since my aunts and uncles all live in another city. Usually, some uncles or aunts wouldn’t come back home to spend spring festival. But at that time, they all came back. In the photo I can see myself standing at the third row with my parents beside me and all my aunts, uncles and cousins standing in rows. In the front row sit my grandparents. They were very happy. We all got our huge smiles on our faces. It was an unforgettable moment and the photograph captured it.</li>

<li>I would suggest them to visit Chongqing. I lived there for five years so I am familiar with it. Firstly, Chongqing has a unique scenery. It’s a mountainous city. Because of this special terrain, the buildings and Pedestrian Malls are built in a different way from other cities. For example, the fourth floor of one building may be the ground level of another one. Secondly, Chongqing has many kinds of delicious food. Hot pot is like world-famous. Everyone in China knows it originate from Chongqing. Besides, there are some other famous food such as Kung Pao Chicken and double-cooked pork slices. Anyway, if one goes to Chongqing, one will feel that every meal is a feast.</li>

<li>When I was in the third summer vacation in the college, I found a job in downtown. I lived on campus at that time but the campus is very far away from downtown so I got to find a place to live nearby. There was one friend who studied in another college located near downtown. He called me to live with him in his dorm since all his roommates were gone. He introduced me to his campus and told me where to eat, where to buy necessities and where to work out. I didn’t have to pay anything for this housing service. Also, living in his dorm saved me a lot of time. I shorten the travel time from 2 hours to 20 minutes.</li>

Also, we all talked about our happy events and unhappy events happened recently and exchanged our ideas about everyone’s events. It was important to me because it’s the first time I attended a small prayer meeting like that and we talked without concealment. It’s like a whole new experience to me.

<li>When I was a sophomore, I took IELTS. I got 8.5 in Listening section which is almost the full mark,9. Originally, I didn’t think I could get above 7 because I couldn’t really follow the speakers’ speed and my vocabulary wasn’t big. So I wasn’t confident. But I knew that my weak point was in listening section, so I listened to the IELTS recordings whenever I had time. When I was walking along the street, I listened to the recordings. When I was relaxing, I listened to the recordings. When I was taking a nap, I listened to the recordings. Besides, I bought a book to enlarge my vocabulary.

<li>Recently, I read an interesting novel named “Keep the aspidistra flying” which is written by George Orwell. I think it’s very interesting because in the story the main character’s experience is similar to mine. The main character wants to be a poet while I want to be a writer. He abandoned his well-paying job for his dream and I also quit my job for my dream. He had a time when he was impoverished and I also experienced a time when I couldn’t afford a lunch. He lives in a society where money talks and I live in a society where money is everything. So these similar experiences make me think the book interesting.</li>

<li>I think airplane is the most efficient type of transportation in my country because it’s fast and comfortable. It only takes me three hours to fly from Beijing to Chongqing. This saves me a lot of time. I can go to Chongqing in the morning and come back to Beijing in the evening. However, if I take train or bus, it’ll take me at least 20 hours. So it’s very fast to take planes. Also, every time I am on the plane, the flight attendant serves me delicious food and drink, all free of charge. But in a train, the attendants aren’t very hospitable and you have to pay for all the food and beverage even though they aren’t of high quality. So that’s why I think taking plane is comfortable.</li>

<li>Basketball is one group activity that is played in my country. It’s enjoyable because people can relax and get exercise from playing basketball. Almost every community in my country has a basketball court and every afternoon adults after work and children after school come to play together. Adults play to relax and to get rid of the tiring work in the morning, while some kids come to play for fun and exercise. Some kids enjoy throwing balls into the basket. Some enjoy running around, dribbling and chasing the one with the ball.</li>

<li>I enjoy biography most, because reading biography tells me a life story of a great person. I get to know the great person’s ups and downs during his or her life and how he or she managed to get through all the difficulties. For example, the biography of Steve Jobs recounts how he was kicked out of Apple. But he continued his career in Computer Science and founded Pixar which created the world-famous film, Toy. Besides, he was invited back to Apple and saved Apple by introducing Ipod. I specially enjoy this part of his life, his great second-coming. I gain inspiration from his experience and from many other biographies and that’s why I enjoy reading biography most.</li>

<ul>
<li>I think attending group activity is a good way to make new friends. In a group activity, people usually have same interests and they perform some tasks together, so there’s a chance that some of the group members need to cooperate. Through cooperation, people start to know each other and then make friends. For example, I always play basketball with strangers. At the beginning, I don’t even know my teammates’ names. But after a few hours’ cooperation, we become friends and start to talk about each other. Sometimes, we even go to have a meal after playing. And actually, this is how I make friends.</li>

<ul>
<li>If I could have any job I wanted, I would choose to be a writer. There are a couple of reasons why I want to be writer. Firstly, being a writer doesn’t need to go to office or a place full of many other people.Writers usually stay at a quiet place and write articles or books. I enjoy being alone, thinking alone and writing things alone. Every time I am alone, I write stories. Secondly, I love the art of telling stories. Writing stories not only pleases myself but may entertain other people, the readers, as well. I especially like the scene in which people laugh and think when they are reading my stories.</li>

<li>I was given an opportunity to study in the US one summer. This opportunity is very important to me for several reasons. Firstly, it was the first time I went abroad. I had imagined going abroad ever since I was a little kid. I never got a chance until that day I received a call from an administrator in my college telling me that I was granted the opportunity to study abroad for the summer vacation. Secondly, I learned and experienced a lot from this opportunity. In this exchange program, I was assigned a partner who was also a college student in the US. He introduced me to his family, took me out to valley faire and instructed me how to use Linux in the computer lab.</li>

<ul>
<li>I imagine my life ten years in the future to be free. My life will be different in one way fromnow that I don’t have to be tied to a job. I can travel around the world, go anywhere, see different things, meet different people, broaden my horizon and thus feel the world. I don’t have to confine myself to just one place. I can go to France, South Africa, South America and Islands in the Pacific. In addition, I can be a freelancer, live on my royalties. I will have plenty of time to write novels and read all the masterpieces. This is what I imagine my life will be in ten years.</li>
<li>I imagine that I may enjoy a more cozy life ten years in the future. First, I might choose a freer job, a freelancer. In this way, I don’t have to commute to the office every day; on the contrary, I can join the team of SOHO. Working at home is definitely more comfortable than confined to a tiny office space. In addition, I may try to realize my dream of travelling around the world—visiting Eiffel Tower in Paris, taking a tour of pyramid in Egypt, and swimming in the sea of Bali. These beautiful sceneries can help me release my pressures, broadening my view. </li>

<li>I think television has a positive influence on society. It’s a good source of news. The members in the society can get news easily from News Channels and thus keep themselves informed of what’s happening around. Like, my grandfather watches News on TV everyday just to keep up with the latest events.Beside television can be a kind of entertainment. People can watch different shows on TV such as funny talk shows and soap operas. I have many friends who like watching Late show with David Letterman and some other friends like watching TV series such as Lost and Friends. They all consider TV as a good way of relaxing themselves and of killing time. So, with the news and same TV programs, people in a society share a lot of things that they can talk about in any event. Therefore, society actually benefits from TV.</li>

<ul>
<li>“Well, I think taking a wide variety of courses is better for students. Because, first of all, I think undergraduate study is meant for broadness. Students had better broaden their horizon and prevent themselves from being narrow-minded. Second of all, I think before students find their “true love”, I mean, the subject they really want to go deep into, they should probably extend their study field and taste different subjects in various areas so as to identify the “true love”. Take myself as an example, my major is software engineering in the college, but I took various courses outside my major field. Then I found out that I was more interested in literature than in computer and software. So literature is my “true love”. I think it depends”</li>

<ul>
<li>I prefer to work on assignments individually. There are two reasons. The first is that I like to be in a quiet place while studying. If I study in a group, I will always be interrupted by group members who talk about irrelevant things. Then it’s possible that I can’t even finish the assignments. Once, I attended a group discussion. Many people were not even discussing. They were just talking about NBA games. When it ended, I got nothing from it. The second reason is that I’d like to think independently. Studying individually gives me enough time to develop my own ideas. When studying in a group, I will always be distracted by other’s opinions and thoughts. So sometimes many assignments are not done by myself but by other group members. Like last week, I worked in a group to solve math problems. It turned out that many problems were solved by others not by myself. I felt very unhappy about it.</li>

<li>I think learning in traditional classrooms is better. The reason why I think so is that there are more interactions in traditional classrooms than in online courses. Students can have discussions and they see each other face to face. It’s highly probable that some of them will become friends. While in the online courses, students don’t know each other, they miss a chance of making friends. Also, in a traditional classroom, if a student doesn’t understand a concept or an idea, he or she can raise hand to ask the teacher directly. While in an online course, there is no chance for students to raise hands or to throw out questions immediately. Students in traditional classrooms not only learn the academic knowledge but also learn basic interpersonal interactions. I prefer to take academic courses on the Internet. Since the courses are offered online, I don’t have to live near campus. All I need is a computer and a well-connected Internet. I can study at home and anywhere convenient. Besides, I don’t have to worry about my housing, nor do I need to drive back and forth. So it saves me money and time. Also, it’s easier to record online courses so I can review the part I don’t understand. With the recorded courses, I can have a good review before final examination.</li>

<ul>
<li>I strongly disagree with the statement that studying math or science is more important than studyingart or literature. Of course, math and science are very important. But it is meaningless to say that they are more important than art or literature. We admire Newton for his scientific achievements such as Newton’s first law. We equally admire Leonardo for his art accomplishments such as MonaLisa. These two people are not comparable because they are in two different fields. So some people may like studyingscience. Some may like studyingliterature. They all make contributions to the human civilizations. So math or science and art or literature, they are equally important.</li>

<ul>
<li>I think having different kinds of work at different points in lives is better. Life has different stages and in each stage people might want to do different things. For example, I have a friend who became a programmer when he just graduated from the college. After three-years programming, he got bored with it and wanted to be a designer. Then he changed his job to design the appearance of computers. After four-year’s designing career, he suddenly wanted to be a writer. Since he never stopped reading and he loved novels, he was good at writing stories. Guess what? Now, he is a freelancer and has published several articles. He believes he has experienced enough and wants to write something out. Life is a long, long journey in which we go to many different places and in each place we do different things.</li>

<li>I prefer to take risks and try new things. I think taking risks is a way to improve oneself, a way to broaden one’s horizon. For example, if Columbia hadn’t taken risks, he wouldn’t have found the New World. If he hadn’t found the New World, his horizon wouldn’t have been broaden so wouldn’t other people’s horizon at that time. Also, trying new things is one of the best ways to learn. Take myself as an example, I didn’t like reading novels until my junior year in the college so novel was a kind of new thing to me at that time. But I tried to read some novels in my junior year, and gradually I became interested in reading novels. Later on, I even started to write my own novels. If I hadn’t tried to read novels, I wouldn’t have known how to write my own novels.</li>

<ul>
<li>I believe friends are the most important influence. We all know that one takes the behavior of one’s company. Friends are always our companies. We play games together, keep secrets and talk anything we like. We share interests and hobbies. For example, many of my friends like playing basketball because I like playing basketball very much. I learned a lot from my friends, their way of talking and their behaviors. However, I rarely spent time with my cousins or with my parents. They might have some influence on me, but they are definitely not the most important influence. In a word, because we are closest to our friends, friends have the most important influence on us.</li>
<li>I believe family members are the most important influence on young adults. Young adults need guidance while they are growing up. Even though they spend most of the time with friends, they need instructions from family members, especially parents. Take myself as an example. When I was in the college, my father always told me the importance of “How to study by oneself.” He called me every week and gave me instructions. On the other hand, even though I spent much time with my friends playing video games or basketball, I didn’t feel that they have much positive influence on me. All they talked about was how to play and how to get laid.I didn’t like that.</li>

<li>I don’t think all children should be required to learn a second language in school. Some children don’t even like to learn language. They are more interested in playing basketball, football and other sports. Even if they are required to learn a second language, they won’t treat it seriously. I had many friends in junior high who didn’t learn language at all. But they could play basketball very well and maybe some of them can become professional players. There is no need to learn a second language to achieve their goal. Also, many of the children won’t have chance to use the second language they learned at school, because when they grow up their job doesn’t need any foreign language skills. For example, many of my high school classmates now work as clerks in banks and they don’t need to use foreign language in their work. Still, they can do just fine.</li>

<li>I think parents should exercise control over the television programs their children watch. It’s a way of protection, since many shows are full of violent or horrifying scenes. But children are not mature enough to bear those scenes so they may feel terrified. Take myself as an example, When I was 7-year-old, I was watching TV alone at home. I accidentally ran into a horror movie and was frightened by the horrible zombies in the movie. They eat human beings and tear bodies into pieces. I was shocked by the bloody scenes. From then on, I started to be afraid of darkness. Every time I walked along the street in the evening, I would feel a zombie following me. I didn’t get rid of the bad influence from that movie until high school.</li>

<li>I think it’s essential for a person’s education to learn to play a musical instrument. There are two reasons why I say so. First, learning to play a musical instrument can give a person a way to express emotion. For example, I have a sister who can play the piano. Every time she was happy or depressed, she’d play the piano. Second, learning to play a musical instrument makes a person artsy or develop a person’s artistic talent. Artistic people are more sensitive than normal ones. They can feel something that others can’t feel. They can sense the emotions from what normal people think is a normal scene. For example, Beethoven can compose his Moonlight at night. But I don’t think anybody can make a moonlight at night.</li>

Since now we have many search engines such as Google and Bing, we just need to input key words and the results will be listed on the screen. From the results, we can always find the information related to the research project. Second, Internet has way more information than do printed materials.

Compared with locating information in the huge library, surfing on the Internet saves lots of time.

<li>I totally agree with this statement that making mistakes is one of the best ways to learn. Through mistakes, we can learn what we don’t understand. After understanding the things we don’t know previously, we improve. Like in high school I had difficulty solving math problems. But I always remembered the problems I couldn’t solve. After asking teachers and discussing with classmates, I could work out these problems easily. Then I improved. Also, sometimes making a mistake is like learning a lesson. When I first went to a western restaurant, I directly went in to find empty seats. Fortunately, my American friend pulled me back and told me that I should wait until a waiter comes by and takes me to the seats. I make a mistake but I gained knowledge.</li>

<ul>
<li>I totally agree with this statement that it’s important to remember and learn from the past.We all make mistakes and we all have to remember mistakes. Because mistakes tell us what isn’t right. For example, when I was in the first grade primary school, I took a toy car from another student without informing him. I was too young to know that taking things from others without mentioning isn’t right. Then my teacher helped the other student find this toy car and labeled me as a thieve. I didn’t realize how serious this matter was until my father told me that this was humiliating. I swore to myself that I would never take anything from others without informing the owners. I think this is a valuable lesson and I’ll remember it forever.</li>

<ul>
<li>I think spending it on practical things is better. Spending large amount of money for pleasure only is not a wise way to handle money. It’ll only make people want to spend more because human desire is insatiable. If you buy a big house, there will be a bigger house. If you buy a large company, there will be a larger company. So wiser people should spend the money on practical things such as setting up a fund for charity, helping those who are in urgent need of food and sanitation, building schools for kids who live in the rural areas and so on. Even opening a bookstore is better than just spending the money only for pleasure.</li>

<ul>
<li>I totally don’t agree with this statement that students shouldn’t be allowed to bring cell phones into the classroom. One important purpose of cell-phone is that we can reach anyone at any time anywhere. If students’ parents need to inform them of some important things and students don’t have mobile phones with them, parents will have to come to the classroom or call others to reach the kids. This sounds pretty inconvenient in a modern age. On the other hand, simply bringing cell-phones into classroom won’t disturb other students or interrupt the class. Students just need to turn their sound off and make the signal to vibration. And if they receive some urgent phone-calls, they can go out to reply.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Tpo-18-1"><a href="#Tpo-18-1" class="headerlink" title="Tpo 18"></a>Tpo 18</h2><iframe width="100%" height="100" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/343815817&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>

<ul>
<li>I totally agree with this statement because we can learn different perspectives from other cultures. It’s important to know different perspectives to be reflective. For example, I went to the US in my sophomore year and found out that many students in the US don’t use their parents’ money. They usually work in the summer to earn tuition fees and living expenses. However, most of my classmates including me use parents’ money without even thinking about it.We believe that it’s our parents’ obligation to pay for the college and give us allowances. I reflected on this issue and thought I should take on the responsibilities myself. Then I took a government loan to pay for the tuition fees and also got some part-time jobs. Therefore, I changed my perspective because I learned a new one from another culture.</li>
<li>I totally agree with this statement. First of all, by learning about other cultures, one can perceive things from totally different views. For example, when I studied in the US, I found out that most of the students there were financially independent, which is completely different from that of Chinese culture. This cultural different led me to realize that being financially independent is a good way to enhance one’s living skills, rather than a burden. In addition, good understanding of alien culture can greatly help us to make friends with foreigners. It is because being familiar with these culture can eliminate the cultural conflicts. Thus, friendship can be established easily without these conflicts.</li>
